The task we have is to create the functional requirements as described below.

You will write the output specification here: `C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\brun\v4-show\pmc\product\03-bmo-functional-requirements-multi-chat-module_v2.md`

the detailed product functional requirements will incorporate all of the below.
It must have very detailed acceptance criteria described for every new feature & function of the module. 
The functional requirements will be implemented in the current codebase.

We are NOT describing HOW to build this module. We are describing in detail what it is especially the User Interface part as we will use this functional requirement to feed to FIGMA Make to make our wireframes.

So now we need to read this spec:

`C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\brun\v4-show\pmc\pmct\c-alpha-build_v3.4-LoRA-FP-100-spec.md`

This represents the "manual" "console" way to create our 90 more conversation JSON records. But we are now going to build a specification that will let our users review, choose, submit, and create the json through a cutting edge, Next.js 14 based application using shadcn/ui as the root UI library.

The current task is to create the functional requirements with detailed UI descriptions document for this module as described below.

You will write the output specification here: `C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\brun\v4-show\pmc\product\03-bmo-functional-requirements-multi-chat-module_v2.md`

We are NOT describing HOW to build this module. We are describing in detail what it is especially the User Interface part as we will use this functional requirement to feed to FIGMA Make to make our wireframes.

So now we need to use this spec: Along with the full project context (must read all):

`C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\brun\v4-show\pmc\product\01-bmo-overview.md` (full product overview)
`C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\BRun\v4-show\pmc\pmct\training-data-seed-instructions\c-alpha-build_v3.4-LoRA-FP-generation_v3.md`
`C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\BRun\v4-show\pmc\pmct\training-data-seed-instructions\GENERATION-COMPLETE-STATUS.md`

Read this: `C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\brun\v4-show\pmc\pmct\training-data-seed-instructions\c-alpha-build_v3.4-LoRA-FP-COMPLETE-DATASET-SUMMARY.md`

`C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\BRun\v4-show\pmc\pmct\training-data-seeds\c-alpha-build_v3.4-LoRA-FP-convo-10-complete.json` (most recent seed file of first "10")

`C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\BRun\v4-show\system\chunks-alpha-data\financial-planner-demo-conversation-and-metadata_v1.txt` (first persona profiles...do we need more personas first before the next dataset creation prompts?)

`C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\BRun\v4-show\pmc\pmct\training-data-seed-instructions\c-alpha-build_v3.4_emotional-dataset-emotional-taxonomy.md`

The goal of this prompt is to create a detailed product functional requirements. The functional requirements must follow this template format: `C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\brun\v4-show\pmc\product\03-bmo-functional-requirements.md`

You will write the output specification here: `C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\brun\v4-show\pmc\product\03-bmo-functional-requirements-multi-chat-module_v2.md`

We are NOT describing HOW to build this module. We are describing in detail what it is especially the User Interface part as we will use this functional requirement to feed to FIGMA Make to make our wireframes. Here is an example of the prompt that will use the functional requirements to create the FIGMA prompt: `C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\brun\v4-show\pmc\product\_mapping\fr-maps\04-bmo-FR-wireframes-output-E06.md`. So this functional requirements document we are creating must be able to provide that level of detail for the UI (or more!)
This module will be implemented in the current codebase.



Module Overview:

It is not practical to implement one prompt to generate 10 conversations. The output file would be too large. So we need to split the prompts to one per conversation. But then we will have so many prompts to manually execute. So we need to build a UI to allow for better processing (ultimately this is part of the core product anyways, so we might as well build it now). You will focus on the User Interface for the front end while making sure that all the back end hookups & processing are described in detail too.  Use a cutting edge Shad/CN library based user interface.

We will use the current codebase found in `C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\brun\v4-show\src` and integrate our new screens and features within this flow. 

We need the UI to:
- Present each the conversations as a line item in a table 
- Allow for the human user to press one button on that line, which will execute the prompt and generate the conversation, which will be saved to the database.
- Allow for the human user to select multiple line items and then press one button that will generate those conversations, sequentially, still one prompt per conversation, which will be saved to the database.
- A "Process All" button which will generate the all scenarios into conversations, sequentially, one prompt per conversation, which will be saved to the database.
- There must be select boxes for the top 8 most important dimensions (persona, emotion, content, etc..) that determine the type of conversation the prompt creates the conversations with. You can select any or all of the boxes and the line item in the table will match the selection(s).

- Our goal for this prompt is to create a functional requirements document  that will let our users review, choose, submit, and create the json through a cutting edge, Next.js 14 based application using shadcn/ui as the root UI library.

The current task is to create the functional requirements with detailed UI descriptions document for this module as described below.


1. As the first part of this process we must migrate our existing seed conversations to the Supabase database. We must build the database tables and the SQL queries that will update the tables.


Operational Functionality
A. Split these into the prompts so that each prompt only generates ONE conversation.
In the perfect world there would only be 3 prompts that will serve the purpose of generating the training data for that set. The three main prompts are:

**Three-Tier Prompts**
- **Tier 1 Prompt (Template-Driven):** 40 conversations (11-50) using 5 emotional arc templates
- **Tier 2 Prompt (Scenario-Based):** 35 conversations (51-85) with custom scenarios
- **Tier 3 Prompt (Edge Cases):** 15 conversations (86-100) testing boundaries

Each of these three prompts must:
1. Generate ONE conversation, per the parameters & conversation requirements
2. Be templatized so that we can feed it parameters and placeholder (string replace) information and it will generate the one specific conversation per those details.
3. Will be part of a UI interface wherein the user selects one of the use cases (each use case is a combination of user/emotional arc/conversation topic/etc) and it will output the prompt generation of those turns

Now as part of this we also need to build:
a. The new UI
b. It must use all the conversation quality tools (JSON template, emotions, personas, specialty signals, etc) to properly convert the input into detailed conversation records.


c. convert the current JSON at to database tables and records. 
It must do this for all the json found here (don't read all of these all. It is too big (14k lines): 
`C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\brun\v4-show\pmc\pmct\training-data-seeds\c-alpha-build_v3.4-LoRA-FP-convo-01-complete.json`
`C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\brun\v4-show\pmc\pmct\training-data-seeds\c-alpha-build_v3.4-LoRA-FP-convo-02-complete.json``C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\brun\v4-show\pmc\pmct\training-data-seeds\c-alpha-build_v3.4-LoRA-FP-convo-01-complete.json`
`C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\brun\v4-show\pmc\pmct\training-data-seeds\c-alpha-build_v3.4-LoRA-FP-convo-03-complete.json`
`C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\brun\v4-show\pmc\pmct\training-data-seeds\c-alpha-build_v3.4-LoRA-FP-convo-04-complete.json`
`C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\brun\v4-show\pmc\pmct\training-data-seeds\c-alpha-build_v3.4-LoRA-FP-convo-05-complete.json`
`C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\brun\v4-show\pmc\pmct\training-data-seeds\c-alpha-build_v3.4-LoRA-FP-convo-06-complete.json`
`C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\brun\v4-show\pmc\pmct\training-data-seeds\c-alpha-build_v3.4-LoRA-FP-convo-07-complete.json`
`C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\brun\v4-show\pmc\pmct\training-data-seeds\c-alpha-build_v3.4-LoRA-FP-convo-08-complete.json`
`C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\brun\v4-show\pmc\pmct\training-data-seeds\c-alpha-build_v3.4-LoRA-FP-convo-09-complete.json`
`C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\brun\v4-show\pmc\pmct\training-data-seeds\c-alpha-build_v3.4-LoRA-FP-convo-10-complete.json`


d. take the "SEED" conversations in the database and turns as input (if the Conversation generator requires it...or just a brief format sampling needed?)

5. The resulting JSON conversation should be stored in the Supabase db. I.E. create tables that will store the JSON conversation and can easily be used to generate the full JSON for a conversation. Unless necessary don't actually store JSON in the database. The app should build it from the database.


2. Include the prompt(s) that I will submit to the Claude-4.5-sonnet Thinking LLM to execute the product build and coding changes. I must be able to cut and paste these prompts into a 200k Claude-4.5-sonnet Thinking context window in Cursor.

3. Make sure as you write the specification you don't leave any important context, direction, or instruction, outside of the prompts. Because the building agent will only see the information that is in the prompt(s)
Organize the successive prompts so that each one can be executed in a new 200k token context window

The next agent is going to use this document to create the detailed UI description. That is why it is so important to have every acceptance criteria described and atomic.

Remember to write the results and output to: `C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\brun\v4-show\pmc\product\03-bmo-functional-requirements-multi-chat-module_v2.md`

## Executive Summary

### Module Purpose

The Training Data Generation Module transforms the manual, console-based conversation generation process into a sophisticated, user-friendly web application. This module enables business owners and domain experts to efficiently generate, review, and manage high-quality LoRA training conversations through an intuitive Next.js 14 interface built with shadcn/ui components.

### Key Objectives

1. **Eliminate Manual Prompt Execution:** Replace the manual console-based process (as described in `c-alpha-build_v3.4-LoRA-FP-100-spec.md`) with an automated, UI-driven workflow
2. **Enable Selective Generation:** Allow users to generate individual conversations, batch-selected conversations, or process all scenarios sequentially
3. **Maintain Quality Standards:** Ensure all generated conversations meet the 95%+ approval rate target established in the platform overview
4. **Database-Driven Architecture:** Migrate existing seed conversations from JSON files to a normalized Supabase database structure
5. **Scalable Prompt Management:** Support three-tier prompt architecture (Template-Driven, Scenario-Based, Edge Cases) with dynamic parameter injection

### User Value Proposition

- **Time Efficiency:** Generate 100 conversations with button clicks instead of manual prompt execution
- **Quality Control:** Review and approve conversations before finalizing training data
- **Flexible Workflow:** Choose between individual, batch, or complete generation modes
- **Transparency:** Real-time progress tracking and status updates throughout generation process
- **Data Integrity:** Centralized database management with version control and audit trails
