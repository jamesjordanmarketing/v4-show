# Interactive LoRA Conversation Generation Module
Product Abbreviation: train
**Version:** 1 
**Date:** 2025-10-25  
**Category:** LoRA Fine Tuning Pairs
**4-Word Vision:**  

**One-Sentence Summary:**  
The Bright Run Training Data Generation Module transforms the manual, console-based process of creating LoRA training conversations into an intuitive, UI-driven workflow that enables non-technical users to generate, review, and manage high-quality conversation datasets through intelligent prompt templates, dimensional filtering, and real-time progress tracking.

## **Module Vision: The Conversation Generation Engine**

This seed narrative defines the foundational requirements for the Bright Run Training Data Generation Module. This module is one of the core modules in the SaaS platform Bright Run, which itself is part of the commercial-grade Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) platform Bright Mode. The Bright Mode platform delivers truly personalized AI for small businesses by creating LLMs that think with the customer's brain and speak with their unique voice.

The Training Data Generation Module receives categorized and chunked documents from the previous pipeline stages and enables users to generate synthetic conversation training data at scale through an interactive web interface. This replaces the current manual console-based approach where users must copy, paste, and execute JSON prompts individually.

The key insight: generating high-quality training conversations requires control, visibility, and flexibility—not just automation. Users need to select, filter, generate, and review conversations individually or in batches, with full transparency into the generation process.

## **The Core Problem:**

After categorizing documents and extracting semantic chunks, businesses need to generate hundreds of high-quality training conversations that reflect their unique expertise, tone, and customer interactions. The current approach requires:
- Manually copying and pasting JSON prompts into Claude
- Executing one prompt at a time in the console
- Manually saving each generated conversation to a file
- No visibility into generation progress or status
- No way to batch-generate multiple conversations
- No structured database to store and manage conversations
- No quality review or approval workflow

This manual process is error-prone, time-consuming, and does not scale to the 90-100 conversations needed per training dataset. Businesses need a sophisticated UI-driven system that automates generation while maintaining human oversight and control.

## **How Life Changes:**

Business experts log into the Bright Run platform and navigate to the Training Data Generation dashboard. They see a clean, organized table showing all potential conversation scenarios derived from their emotional taxonomy, persona profiles, and content categories. Each row represents one conversation to be generated.

Users can:
- Filter conversations by persona, emotion, topic, intent, and other dimensions
- Generate a single conversation by clicking "Generate" on any row
- Select multiple conversations and batch-generate them sequentially
- Click "Generate All" to process the entire dataset
- Watch real-time progress indicators showing which conversation is being generated
- Review generated conversations in a formatted preview panel
- Approve, reject, or flag conversations for editing
- Export approved conversations as JSON for LoRA training

The system handles all the technical complexity—prompt template management, parameter injection, API calls, response validation, database storage—while giving users complete visibility and control over the generation process.

## **Input/Output for this Module:**

This module is the third stage in the larger LoRA training data creation pipeline.

**Input:** 
- Categorized documents with metadata from Document Categorization module
- Semantic chunks with 60 dimensions from Chunk-Alpha module
- 10 seed conversations (already generated manually via console)
- Emotional taxonomy defining conversation dimensions
- Persona profiles with characteristics and traits
- Scenario templates for conversation contexts

**Output:** 
- 90-100 additional synthetic training conversations stored in Supabase
- Normalized database schema supporting:
  - Master conversation records
  - Individual dialogue turns
  - Conversation metadata and dimensions
  - Generation audit logs and history
- Structured JSON exports ready for LoRA training pipeline

## **System Context & Architecture Vision**

### **Current State: Console-Based Generation**

The current system (documented in `C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\BRun\v4-show\pmc\pmct\c-alpha-build_v3.4-LoRA-FP-100-spec.md`) requires:
1. User opens text editor with JSON prompt template
2. User manually replaces placeholders (persona, emotion, topic, etc.)
3. User copies entire prompt to Claude console
4. User waits for Claude to generate conversation
5. User copies response and saves to JSON file
6. User repeats 90 more times for complete dataset

This works but does not scale or provide quality controls.

### **Future State: UI-Driven Generation**

The new system will provide:
1. **Conversation Dashboard** - Table view of all conversation scenarios
2. **Dimensional Filters** - Multi-select controls for persona, emotion, content type, intent, tone, topic cluster, outcome type
3. **Generation Controls** - Single, batch, and "generate all" buttons
4. **Progress Monitoring** - Real-time status indicators and logs
5. **Review Interface** - Formatted conversation preview with approval workflow
6. **Database Management** - Normalized Supabase schema with full audit trail
7. **Export Capabilities** - Structured JSON export for training pipeline

### **Integration Points**

**Codebase Location:** `C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\brun\v4-show\src`

The module will integrate into the existing Next.js 14 application using:
- Existing authentication and user management
- Shared UI component library (shadcn/ui)
- Consistent styling and design patterns
- Common database service layer (Supabase)
- Established API patterns and error handling

**Data Dependencies:**
- Must read document categories from `documents` and `document_categories` tables
- Must read chunk data from `chunks` and `chunk_dimensions` tables
- Must access persona profiles and emotional taxonomy data
- Must read and display 10 seed conversations as examples

## **Three-Tier Prompt Architecture**

The system uses a sophisticated three-tier approach to conversation generation:

### **Tier 1: Template-Driven Conversations (40 conversations)**
**Purpose:** Generate bulk dataset foundation using emotional arc templates

**Characteristics:**
- Based on 5 emotional arc templates (Triumph, Struggle-to-Success, Plateau-to-Breakthrough, Emergency-to-Calm, Exploratory)
- Each template defines emotional progression throughout conversation
- Parameters: persona type, starting emotion, ending emotion, topic category
- Highly structured and predictable format
- Ideal for foundational training data

**Example Scenario:**
- Persona: Anxious First-Time Investor
- Arc Template: Struggle-to-Success
- Starting Emotion: Fear/Uncertainty
- Ending Emotion: Confidence/Relief
- Topic: Initial Portfolio Setup

### **Tier 2: Scenario-Based Conversations (35 conversations)**
**Purpose:** Add domain realism through context-rich scenarios

**Characteristics:**
- Based on real-world customer situations
- Incorporates domain expertise and industry context

- More nuanced and realistic than template-driven
- Captures authentic problem-solving interactions

**Example Scenario:**
- Persona: Mid-Career Professional
- Context: Inheritance windfall + career transition + retirement concerns
- Complexity: High (multiple interrelated financial decisions)
- Desired Outcome: Comprehensive financial plan with prioritized actions

### **Tier 3: Edge Case Conversations (15 conversations)**
**Purpose:** Test boundaries and handle unusual situations

**Characteristics:**
- Tests system robustness with unusual scenarios
- Handles edge cases, boundary conditions, extreme emotions
- Parameters: edge case type, stress factors, resolution strategy
- Ensures model can handle difficult conversations
- Validates broad capability coverage

**Example Scenario:**
- Persona: Recently Widowed + Financial Trauma
- Edge Case Type: Emotional overwhelm + urgent decisions
- Stress Factors: Grief, time pressure, financial confusion
- Resolution: Empathetic pacing + simplified action steps

- **Response Schema:** Expected JSON structure for validation
- **Active/Inactive:** Toggle for testing new templates

### **Parameter Injection**
Before sending to Claude API:
1. Load appropriate template based on tier and configuration
2. Replace all placeholders with actual values from conversation parameters
3. Validate all required parameters are present
4. Format as proper Claude API request

### **Response Validation**
After receiving Claude response:
1. Parse JSON structure
2. Validate against expected schema
3. Check conversation meets quality criteria (turn count, length, etc.)
4. Calculate quality score
5. Store in database with validation results

---

## **Generation Workflow**

### **Single Conversation Generation**
1. User clicks "Generate" button on conversation row
2. System loads conversation parameters (persona, emotion, topic, etc.)
3. System selects appropriate prompt template based on tier
4. System injects parameters into template
5. System calls Claude API with constructed prompt
6. System validates response structure and quality
7. System parses conversation turns
8. System saves conversation and turns to database
9. System updates conversation status to "Generated"
10. System displays success notification
11. System refreshes table row to show new status

### **Batch Generation**
1. User selects multiple conversations (checkboxes)
2. User clicks "Generate Selected" button
3. System creates generation queue with selected conversations
4. System shows progress modal with live status
5. For each conversation in queue:
   - Generate conversation (same as single flow)
   - Update progress indicator
   - Log success/failure
   - Continue to next conversation
6. System shows completion summary (X succeeded, Y failed)
7. System updates table to show all new statuses

### **Generate All**
- Same as batch generation but includes all conversations in table
- Special confirmation dialog warning about cost and time
- Ability to resume if interrupted

2. **Incremental Progress:** Users can generate one, some, or all conversations. System supports all workflows.
3. **Quality Over Speed:** Better to generate 90 high-quality conversations slowly than 100 mediocre ones quickly.
4. **Transparency:** Users always know what's happening, why, and what to do next.
5. **Fault Tolerance:** Failures don't lose data. Users can retry, skip, or continue.

### **Technical Constraints**
1. **API Rate Limits:** Claude API has rate limits. System must handle throttling gracefully.
2. **Cost Management:** Each conversation costs $0.02-0.05. Users should see cost estimates.
3. **Response Time:** Claude responses take 15-45 seconds. UI must show progress.
4. **Database Size:** 100 conversations with 8-16 turns each = 800-1600 turn records. Schema must be efficient.
5. **Browser Performance:** Table with 100 rows must remain responsive with filtering/sorting.

### **Business Constraints**
1. **Timeline:** Module should reach MVP within 2-3 development sprints
