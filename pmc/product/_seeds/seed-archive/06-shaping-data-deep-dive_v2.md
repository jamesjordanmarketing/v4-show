# Prompt: Shaping Data & Philosophy Deep Dive (v2)

**Role:** Product Architect & Systems Thinker
**Objective:** Analyze the current "Shaping Data" approach for the Bright Run LoRA training platform and propose a more robust, results-oriented ontology that aligns client goals with training data generation.

## 1. Context & Input Data
You are working on **Bright Run**, a platform that helps small businesses turn their proprietary documents into LoRA training data.
Currently, the system extracts "Chunks" from documents and generates 60+ dimensions of metadata.
However, we need to define how we "shape" these chunks into actual conversations/training pairs that meet specific client goals (e.g., "Train a model to think like me" vs "Train a model to sell like me").

**Mandatory Reading:**
Please read the following context files to understand the current product architecture and philosophy:

## 2. The Problem Statement
The current system relies on 4 basic "Shaping" variables for generating conversations:
1.  **Persona** (e.g., "Sales Professional")
2.  **Emotional Arc** (e.g., "Curiosity -> Skepticism")
3.  **Complexity** (0.0 - 1.0)
4.  **Domain/Topic**

**The Core Issues:**
1.  **Too Generic:** These parameters are "big picture" industry standards that don't necessarily connect to the *specific* content of the client's documents (Chunks).
2.  **User Friction:** Manual creation of personas/topics is tedious and error-prone for users.
3.  **Goal Mismatch:** A client might upload a "Process Document" but want to train on "Emotional Intelligence". The current system might miss this intent if it only looks at the document's literal content.
4.  **Granularity Disconnect:** We have highly granular "Chunk" data, but we lack the "Middle Layer" that bridges these chunks to the client's high-level business goals.

## 3. Your Task
Write a detailed analysis and proposal document that addresses the following points.

### A. Analysis of the Disconnect
Analyze the gap between the granular "Chunks" data and the high-level "Shaping" parameters.
*   Is document annotation too granular for defining conversation flows?
*   How do we bridge the gap between "My proprietary process" (Document) and "How I want my AI to speak" (Goal)?

### B. Proposed "Results-Oriented" Ontology
Instead of just "Personas" and "Topics", propose a new set of "Shaping Buckets" or categories based on **Client Results**.
*   *Example:* "Philosophy & Beliefs", "Knowledge Organization", "Emotional Dynamics".
*   Define at least 3-5 core "Buckets" that would allow a client to say "This is what I want to achieve" and have the system understand how to shape the data accordingly.

### C. Data Collection Strategy
How should we collect this shaping data?
*   **Implicitly:** Can we scrape their website/docs to infer these values? (e.g., "Give us your URL and we'll figure out your Brand Voice").
*   **Explicitly:** What is the "Structured Start" questionnaire? (e.g., "What is the goal of this AI?").
*   **Hybrid:** How do we combine manual input with AI inference?

### D. Three "Paths Forward"
Propose 3 distinct strategic directions for this iteration of the application. These should not be detailed implementation plans, but "Big Picture" approaches.
*   *Example Path 1:* **The Modular Builder** (Manual, granular control for power users).
*   *Example Path 2:* **The Goal-Driven Wizard** (High-level goals drive low-level params; "I want a Sales Bot" -> Auto-configures Persona/Arc).
*   *Example Path 3:* **The Digital Twin Scraper** (Fully automated inference from existing web presence/documents).

## 4. Constraints & Output
- **Validate:** Ensure your ideas are compatible with the existing `src` codebase structure and Supabase schema (conceptually).
- **Output Location:** Write your response to: `C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\BRun\v4-show\pmc\pmct\iteration-1-philosophy_v1.md`
