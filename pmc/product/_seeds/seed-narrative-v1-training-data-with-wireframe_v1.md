# Final Build Spec — Markdown Conversion

## Introduction

ok. so now we have the full specification details, all questions answered, all dimensions organized and defined, and the context prompts for the llm engineering.
Next we must take all of this information and write up one final specification for the that will take everything we have documented in the files below.

## Foundational Documentations
First read the foundational documentations for this project:
I need you to read the product overview here:
C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\brun\v4-show\pmc\product\01-bmo-overview.md

and then read the current Category module overview here:
C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\brun\v4-show\pmc\product\01-bmo-overview-categ-module_v1.md

and then read the current chunks building module overview here:
C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\brun\v4-show\pmc\product\01-bmo-overview-chunk-alpha_v2.md

Then become intimately related to the codebases of both the module we are building on top of:
C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\brun\v4-show\src
and the codebase of the wireframe that will provide our UI: C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\brun\v4-show\train-wireframe\src


## 1. Existing Specs
Here is the existing functional requirements document C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\brun\v4-show\pmc\product\03-train-functional-requirements-before-wireframe.md

that was written and used to build the VITE wireframe here: 
C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\brun\v4-show\train-wireframe\src

Also these previous specs here:
C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\brun\v4-show\pmc\pmct\c-alpha-build_v3.4-LoRA-FP-100-spec.md
C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\brun\v4-show\pmc\pmct\training-data-seed-instructions\c-alpha-build_v3.4-LoRA-FP-convo-steps_v2.md
C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\brun\v4-show\pmc\pmct\training-data-seed-instructions\c-alpha-build_v3.4-LoRA-FP-convo-steps-carryover_v1.md
have a lot of important details. 
The requirements within these steps were used to build: C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\brun\v4-show\pmc\product\03-train-functional-requirements-before-wireframe.md 
but the requirements of this version of the spec must find and implement all acceptance criteria. So check to see if anything important is in them that is not in the `03-train-functional-requirements-before-wireframe.md` file.


----------------
Then we need to build a new spec. The new spec will:

1. Use the C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\brun\v4-show\pmc\product\03-train-functional-requirements-before-wireframe.md as the foundation of the format, structure, and the granularity of detail, and even a lot (not all) of the content.

2. Uses the wireframe here: C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\brun\v4-show\train-wireframe\src as a real life implementation of the UI details in C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\brun\v4-show\pmc\product\03-train-functional-requirements-before-wireframe.md.
Where there is a conflict the wireframe UI implementation takes precedence.

3. Converts the wireframe here C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\brun\v4-show\train-wireframe\src from the VITE demo library into our core app in C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\brun\v4-show\src

4. Creates a a new functional spec file that:

a. Replaces any build UI specifications, new screens, Core UI Components & Layouts, or building from scratch with the current VITE Wireframe specification and implementation.
b. Replaces all the UI FR's in C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\brun\v4-show\pmc\product\03-train-functional-requirements-before-wireframe.md with a similar FR that uses the WIREFRAME as the base. The UI job is mainly to now convert the wireframe into a functional Next.js 14 application.
c. Keeps all the functional requirements in C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\brun\v4-show\pmc\product\03-train-functional-requirements-before-wireframe.md that are related to the backend processing, API processing, and connect the back end processing with the wireframe based UI

5. Removes from the current C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\brun\v4-show\pmc\product\03-train-functional-requirements-before-wireframe.md spec any FRs related to 
-Performance & Scalability
-Cost Tracking & Transparency
-Review & Approval Workflow
-Audit Trail & Logging Tables
-Database Performance & Optimization

6. Integrates the UI implementation of C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\brun\v4-show\train-wireframe\src with the operational functionality of C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\brun\v4-show\pmc\product\03-train-functional-requirements-before-wireframe.md so that it will fulfil the ultimate functionality and deliverable goal of the module
