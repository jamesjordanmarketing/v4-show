- Main Codebase: `src\`

**Reorganization Notes:**
This document has been enhanced with insights from the implemented wireframe UI and main codebase integration. All functional requirements now include:
- Testable acceptance criteria based on actual implementation
- Direct codebase file path references for validation
- Enhanced UI/UX specifications from wireframe patterns
- Database schema validation from implemented models
- API endpoint specifications from actual routes

All FR numbers preserved from v2.0.0 for traceability. Original User Story (US) references maintained.

## Document Enhancement Summary

**Key Enhancements in v3.0.0:**
1. **UI Component Integration**: All UI requirements now reference actual wireframe components
2. **Database Validation**: Acceptance criteria validated against implemented Supabase schemas  
3. **API Specification**: Requirements include actual API endpoint paths and parameters
4. **State Management**: Requirements reference Zustand store implementation patterns
5. **Type Safety**: All data structures validated against TypeScript type definitions
6. **Testable Criteria**: Every acceptance criterion now includes validation approach

**Wireframe Components Integrated:**
- Dashboard with conversation table, filters, pagination (ConversationTable.tsx, FilterBar.tsx)
- Three-tier workflow (TemplatesView.tsx, ScenariosView.tsx, EdgeCasesView.tsx)
- Batch generation interface (BatchGenerationModal.tsx)
- Review queue system (ReviewQueueView.tsx)
- Export functionality (ExportModal.tsx)
- Quality metrics visualization (Dashboard stats cards)

    - Format selector with descriptions
    - Preview export structure before download
    - Format-specific options (e.g., JSONL: include system prompts, flatten conversations)
    - File naming convention: lora-pipeline-{tier}-{date}-{count}.{ext}
    - Automatic compression for large exports (>1000 conversations)
  * Functional Requirements Acceptance Criteria:
    - Export modal must use ExportModal component
      Code Reference: `train-wireframe/src/components/export/ExportModal.tsx`
    - Format selector must use radio group or dropdown
    - Export formats must match ExportConfig type
      Code Reference: `train-wireframe/src/lib/types.ts:181-194`
    - JSONL format must output one conversation per line
    - JSON format must output array of conversation objects
    - CSV format must flatten conversations into rows (one turn per row)
    - Markdown format must format conversations as readable dialogue
    - Format descriptions must explain use case for each format
    - Preview must show first 3 conversations in selected format
    - File naming must use template: {prefix}-{tier}-{YYYY-MM-DD}-{count}.{extension}
    - Compression must trigger automatically if conversation count > 1000
    - Compressed files must use .zip format

- **FR5.1.2:** Export Filtering and Selection
  * Description: Export specific subsets of conversations based on filters or selection
  * Impact Weighting: Precision / Efficiency
  * Priority: High
