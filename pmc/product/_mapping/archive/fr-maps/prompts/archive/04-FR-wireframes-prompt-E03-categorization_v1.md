- Use the following markers when writing the final output block:
  - === BEGIN PROMPT FR: FR3.3.1 ===
  - === END PROMPT FR: FR3.3.1 ===

What to do
0) Extract journey context for Stage 3:
   - User goals and workflows for this stage
   - Emotional journey points
   - Success celebration moments
   - Progressive disclosure requirements
   - Persona-specific UI adaptations
1) Identify FR FR3.3.1 in the Task-Specific FR Map and collect all acceptance criteria:
   - User Story Acceptance Criteria mapped to this FR
   - Functional Requirements Acceptance Criteria for this FR
2) Classify each criterion as UI-relevant vs Non-UI.
3) Compute a Page Plan (≥ 3) to satisfy all UI-relevant criteria with clear flows and states.
4) Generate a self-contained Figma Make AI prompt that embeds all UI-relevant criteria, includes annotations instructions, and does not require external file access.

Wireframe Goals
- [Bulleted goals mapped to this FR]

Explicit UI Requirements (from acceptance criteria)
- [Each UI-relevant criterion rewritten as concrete UI elements, components, states, interactions]
- Include validation, error, loading, empty, success, disabled, in-progress states as applicable

Interactions and Flows
- [Describe navigation and key interactions required by the criteria]
