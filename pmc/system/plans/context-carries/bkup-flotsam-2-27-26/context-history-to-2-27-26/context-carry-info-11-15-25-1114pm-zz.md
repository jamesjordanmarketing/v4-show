## 📌 Active Development Focus

**Primary Task**: LoRA Training Pipeline Implementation - Section E05 Specification Created (Model Artifacts & Delivery)

### Current Status: E05 v2 Specification Complete, Git Push Protection Issue (December 29, 2025)

Sections E01-E03b are **deployed to production** with bug fixes applied. Section E04.5 (RunPod infrastructure) has completed Phase 1-3 (network volume, model cache, Docker worker code generated and uploaded). We have now created **Section E05 v2 specification** with updated deployed infrastructure details (RunPod endpoint, API keys, Supabase project details).

**Implementation Status**: ✅ E05 V2 SPECIFICATION COMPLETE  
**Project ID**: hqhtbxlgzysfbekexwku  
**Environment**: 
- E01-E03b: Deployed to Vercel production (December 27, 2025)
- E04.5 Phase 1: Complete (network volume + model cached)
- E04.5 Phase 2: Complete (all Docker worker files generated)
- E04.5 Phase 3: Complete (files uploaded to RunPod)
- E05 Specification v2: Complete (December 29, 2025)

## ✅ What Was Accomplished in This Session (December 29, 2025)

This session focused on **understanding the current state of the codebase** and **addressing a Git push protection issue** related to embedded RunPod API keys.

### Session Overview

**Purpose**: User encountered GitHub push protection blocking a commit due to detected secrets (RunPod API key) in the E05 specification markdown file.

**Issue**: GitHub's secret scanning detected a RunPod API key hardcoded in `04f-pipeline-build-section-E05-execution-prompts_v2.md` at lines 17, 262, and 526.

**Key Exposed:**
- RunPod API Key: `********************`
- RunPod Endpoint: `https://api.runpod.ai/v2/ei82ickpenoqlp`

**Guidance Provided**:
1. **Immediate Solution**: Use GitHub's bypass URL to allow the secret temporarily
2. **Security Warning**: API key is now exposed in commit history and should be rotated ASAP
3. **Better Practice**: Move secrets to environment variables instead of hardcoding
4. **Long-term Solution**: Update documentation to reference environment variables only

**Action Recommended**:
- User should visit the bypass URL provided by GitHub to allow the push
- After push completes, immediately refactor to use environment variables
- Rotate the RunPod API key after secrets are removed from the repository

**No Code Changes Made**: This session was purely advisory regarding Git security and secret management practices.

## 📋 Section E05: Model Artifacts & Delivery (v2) - Specification Status

### What This Section Does

Section E05 is the **final functional section** that completes the LoRA training pipeline, enabling users to access and deploy their trained models.

**Key Components**:
1. **Artifact Creation Edge Function** - Background processor that creates model artifact records when training jobs complete
2. **Model Download from GPU Cluster** - Downloads trained model files from RunPod
3. **Upload to Supabase Storage** - Stores model files in the `lora-models` bucket
4. **Quality Metrics Calculation** - Calculates quality ratings from training history
5. **Model Artifacts Pages** - UI for browsing, viewing, and downloading trained models
6. **Secure Download URLs** - On-demand signed URLs for model file downloads

## 🔜 What's Ready for Implementation

### For Git Security Resolution (IMMEDIATE NEXT STEP)

**Step 1: Bypass GitHub Push Protection** (Temporary)
Visit the bypass URL provided by GitHub:
```
https://github.com/jamesjordanmarketing/v4-show/security/secret-scanning/unblock-secret/37YKPx8TU7EgQARDMk3E9GTK7F3
```

Click "Allow secret" and then push again:
```bash
git push
```

**Step 2: Refactor Specification to Use Environment Variables**
Update `04f-pipeline-build-section-E05-execution-prompts_v2.md`:
- Replace hardcoded API key references with `<See environment variables>` or `Deno.env.get('GPU_CLUSTER_API_KEY')!`
- Update deployment instructions to reference environment variable configuration
- Commit and push the cleaned version

**Step 3: Rotate RunPod API Key**
- Login to RunPod dashboard
- Generate new API key
- Update environment variables in Supabase Edge Function secrets
- Update `.env.local` in application

### For Docker Build (After Security Resolution)

**Execute on RunPod Build Pod** (via web terminal at `/workspace/v4-show/`):

**Step 1: Build Docker Image**
```bash
cd /workspace/brightrun-trainer
docker build --platform linux/amd64 -t brighthub/brightrun-trainer:v1 .
```

**Expected Time**: 5-10 minutes  
**Expected Output**: Successfully built image with all dependencies installed  
**Validation**: `docker images | grep brightrun-trainer`

**Step 2: Login to Docker Hub**
```bash
docker login
```
(Enter Docker Hub username and password when prompted)

## 🎯 NEXT AGENT: Critical Instructions

### ⚠️ MANDATORY: Read This First

**DO NOT start implementing, fixing, or writing anything immediately.**

Your ONLY job right now is to:
1. ✅ Read and internalize ALL context files listed below
2. ✅ Understand the codebase architecture and patterns
3. ✅ Understand what has been implemented (E01-E03b)
4. ✅ Understand what is complete (E04.5 Phase 1-3)
5. ✅ Understand the E05 specification status (v2 created, git push blocked)
6. ✅ **STOP and WAIT for explicit human instructions**

### PHASE A: Context Internalization (MANDATORY - 20-24 hours)

Read and understand ALL of the following before receiving any task instructions:

#### 1. Production Codebase (HIGHEST PRIORITY - START HERE)

**Directory**: `C:\\Users\\james\\Master\\BrightHub\\BRun\\v4-show\\src`

**Purpose**: Understand the existing Next.js + Supabase application architecture, patterns, and conventions.

**What to Study**:

- **API Routes** (`src/app/api/**/route.ts`):
  - Authentication patterns using `requireAuth()`
  - Response format: `{ success: true, data: ... }` or `{ error: '...', details: ... }`
  - Error handling and rollback logic
  - Supabase client usage (server-side)
  - RLS enforcement patterns
  - Zod validation schemas

- **React Hooks** (`src/hooks/*.ts`):
  - React Query patterns (`useQuery`, `useMutation`)
  - Cache invalidation strategies (`invalidateQueries`)
  - Toast notifications using `sonner` library (correct import: `import { toast } from 'sonner'`)
  - Error handling in hooks
  - TypeScript typing conventions
  - Debouncing patterns (`useDebounce`)

- **UI Components** (`src/components/**/*.tsx`):
  - Shadcn/ui component library usage
  - Tailwind CSS styling conventions
  - Loading states and skeletons
  - Empty states and error states
  - Responsive design patterns
  - Interactive form controls (sliders, selects)

- **Services** (`src/services/**/*.ts`):
  - Business logic separation
  - Service layer patterns
  - External API integrations (Claude API)
  - File upload/download handling

- **Types** (`src/lib/types/**/*.ts`):
  - TypeScript interface conventions
  - Zod schema validation patterns
  - Type inference from Zod schemas
  - Enum definitions

- **Supabase Integration** (`src/lib/supabase-*.ts`):
  - Server client creation: `createServerSupabaseClient()` **requires await**
  - Admin client for privileged operations
  - Authentication helpers: `requireAuth()`
  - Storage operations (presigned URLs)

**Time Investment**: 5-6 hours (critical - don't rush)

**Why This Matters**: Every new feature must follow these established patterns. Consistency is essential.

- Content: Complete TypeScript implementation code for artifact creation Edge Function, API routes, React hooks, and UI pages

Waiting for human instructions on what to do next.

Total time invested in context internalization: ~20-24 hours
```

**Do NOT**:
- Make suggestions about what to do next
- Ask "Would you like me to..." questions
- Propose improvements or fixes
- Start analyzing code for issues

**Simply WAIT** for the human to tell you explicitly what task to perform next.

---

### Total Context Internalization Time: ~20-24 hours

This is intentional and necessary. Rushing through context leads to:
- Inconsistent code patterns
- Breaking existing functionality
- Misunderstanding requirements
- Needing to redo work later

**Take your time. Read carefully. Understand deeply.**

## 🔍 Supabase Agent Ops Library (SAOL) Quick Reference

**Version:** 2.1 (Bug Fixes Applied - December 6, 2025)

### Setup & Usage

**Installation**: Already available in project
```bash
# SAOL is installed and configured
# Located in supa-agent-ops/ directory
```

**CRITICAL: You MUST use the Supabase Agent Ops Library (SAOL) for ALL database operations.**
Do not use raw `supabase-js` or PostgreSQL scripts. SAOL is safe, robust, and handles edge cases for you.

**Library Path:** supa-agent-ops
**Quick Start:** QUICK_START.md (READ THIS FIRST)
**Troubleshooting:** TROUBLESHOOTING.md

### Key Rules
1. **Use Service Role Key:** Operations require admin privileges. Ensure `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` is loaded.
2. **Run Preflight:** Always run `agentPreflight({ table })` before modifying data.
3. **No Manual Escaping:** SAOL handles special characters automatically.
4. **Parameter Flexibility:** SAOL accepts both `where`/`column` (recommended) and `filters`/`field` (backward compatible).

### Quick Reference: One-Liner Commands

**Note:** All examples updated for SAOL v2.1 with bug fixes applied.

cd "c:/Users/james/Master/BrightHub/BRun/v4-show/supa-agent-ops" && node -e "require('dotenv').config({path:'../.env.local'});const saol=require('.');(async()=>{const r=await saol.agentQuery({table:'conversations',select:'id,conversation_id,enrichment_status,title',where:[{column:'enrichment_status',operator:'eq',value:'completed'}],orderBy:[{column:'created_at',asc:false}],limit:10});console.log('Success:',r.success,'Count:',r.data.length);r.data.forEach(c=>console.log('-',c.conversation_id.slice(0,8),'/',c.enrichment_status));})();"
```

**Check training files**:
```bash
cd "c:/Users/james/Master/BrightHub/BRun/v4-show/supa-agent-ops" && node -e "require('dotenv').config({path:'../.env.local'});const saol=require('.');(async()=>{const r=await saol.agentQuery({table:'training_files',select:'id,name,conversation_count,total_training_pairs,created_at',orderBy:[{column:'created_at',asc:false}],limit:5});console.log('Files:',r.data.length);r.data.forEach(f=>console.log('-',f.name,'(',f.conversation_count,'convs)'));})();"
```

**Check prompt templates (edge case tier)**:
```bash
cd "c:/Users/james/Master/BrightHub/BRun/v4-show/supa-agent-ops" && node -e "require('dotenv').config({path:'../.env.local'});const saol=require('.');(async()=>{const r=await saol.agentQuery({table:'prompt_templates',select:'template_name,tier,emotional_arc_type',where:[{column:'tier',operator:'eq',value:'edge_case'}]});console.log('Edge case templates:',r.data.length);r.data.forEach(t=>console.log('-',t.template_name));})();"
```

**Check emotional arcs (edge case tier)**:
```bash
cd "c:/Users/james/Master/BrightHub/BRun/v4-show/supa-agent-ops" && node -e "require('dotenv').config({path:'../.env.local'});const saol=require('.');(async()=>{const r=await saol.agentQuery({table:'emotional_arcs',select:'arc_key,name,tier',where:[{column:'tier',operator:'eq',value:'edge_case'}]});console.log('Edge case arcs:',r.data.length);r.data.forEach(a=>console.log('-',a.arc_key,'→',a.name));})();"
```

### SAOL Parameter Formats (Both Work)

**Recommended Format** (clear intent):
```javascript
const result = await saol.agentQuery({
  table: 'prompt_templates',
  select: ['template_name', 'tier', 'emotional_arc_type'],  // Array
  where: [{ column: 'tier', operator: 'eq', value: 'edge_case' }],  // where + column
  orderBy: [{ column: 'created_at', asc: false }]
});
```

**Backward Compatible Format**:
```javascript
const result = await saol.agentQuery({
  table: 'prompt_templates',
  select: 'template_name,tier,emotional_arc_type',  // String
  filters: [{ field: 'tier', operator: 'eq', value: 'edge_case' }],  // filters + field
  orderBy: [{ column: 'created_at', asc: false }]
});
```

## 📋 Project Functional Context

### What This Application Does

**Bright Run LoRA Training Data Platform** - A Next.js 14 application that generates high-quality AI training conversations for fine-tuning large language models. The platform enables non-technical domain experts to transform proprietary knowledge into LoRA-ready training datasets and execute GPU training jobs.

**Core Capabilities**:
1. **Conversation Generation**: AI-powered generation using Claude API with predetermined field structure
2. **Enrichment Pipeline**: 5-stage validation and enrichment process for quality assurance
3. **Storage System**: File storage (Supabase Storage) + metadata (PostgreSQL)
4. **Management Dashboard**: UI for reviewing, downloading, and managing conversations
5. **Download System**: Export both raw (minimal) and enriched (complete) JSON formats
6. **LoRA Training Pipeline** (NEW):
   - **Section E02 (DEPLOYED)**: Dataset upload with presigned URLs (up to 500MB), background validation, dataset management
   - **Section E03 (DEPLOYED)**: Training job configuration with presets, cost estimation, job creation
   - **Section E03b (DEPLOYED)**: Training files to datasets migration bridge
   - **Section E04.5 (PHASE 3 COMPLETE)**: RunPod GPU infrastructure setup (network volume + Docker worker code + files uploaded)
   - **Section E04 (NEXT)**: Training execution, real-time monitoring, job management
   - **Section E05 (SPECIFICATION COMPLETE)**: Model artifacts, quality metrics, secure downloads

### Core Workflow

```
User → Generate Conversation → Claude API → Raw JSON Stored →
Enrichment Pipeline (5 stages) → Enriched JSON Stored →
Dashboard View → Download (Raw or Enriched) → Combine Multiple JSON files into a full training file →
[E02] Upload to LoRA Pipeline → Validate Dataset →
[E03] Configure Training Job (Presets + Cost Estimation) → Create Job (status='queued') →
[E04.5] RunPod Infrastructure (GPU + Model Cache + Docker Worker Code) →
[E04] Execute Training → Monitor Progress → Download Trained Model →
[E05] Model Artifacts → Quality Metrics → Secure Download
```

## 🔐 Security Advisory (December 29, 2025)

### RunPod API Key Exposure in Git History

**Issue**: RunPod API key hardcoded in Section E05 v2 specification file

**Exposed Credentials**:
- RunPod API Key: `**********************`
- RunPod Endpoint: `https://api.runpod.ai/v2/ei82ickpenoqlp`

**File**: `pmc/product/_mapping/pipeline/full-build/04f-pipeline-build-section-E05-execution-prompts_v2.md`
**Lines**: 17, 262, 526

**Impact**:
- API key is visible in Git commit history
- Anyone with repository access can see and potentially use this key
- Key has permissions to submit training jobs to RunPod endpoint

**Remediation Steps**:
1. ✅ Bypass GitHub push protection (temporary workaround)
2. ⏸️ Refactor specification to use environment variable references
3. ⏸️ Rotate RunPod API key in RunPod dashboard
4. ⏸️ Update environment variables in Supabase Edge Functions and `.env.local`

**Status**: ⚠️ AWAITING USER ACTION (bypass URL provided in this session)

---

**Last Updated**: December 29, 2025 (evening session)  
**Session Focus**: E05 v2 specification review + Git push protection advisory  
**Current State**: E01-E03b deployed, E04.5 Phase 1-3 complete, E05 specification v2 complete, Git push blocked  
**Document Version**: e05-specification-git-security-advisory  
**Next Phase**: Resolve Git push protection → Continue with E04.5 Docker build → E04 implementation → E05 implementation  
**Implementation Location (E04.5)**: `C:\\Users\\james\\Master\\BrightHub\\BRun\\brightrun-trainer\\` (separate from multi-chat repo)  
**Specification Location (E05)**: `C:\\Users\\james\\Master\\BrightHub\\BRun\\v4-show\\pmc\\product\\_mapping\\pipeline\\full-build\\04f-pipeline-build-section-E05-execution-prompts_v2.md` (1,842 lines)  
**Blocker**: Git push protection blocking commit with RunPod API key  
**Security Risk**: RunPod API key exposed in specification file - requires rotation after refactoring
