=========================Prompt=For=Building=Context=========================================
You are tasked with updating the context carryover file at:
pmc/system/plans/context-carries/context-carry-info-10-09-25-948am.md

First, read the entire file to understand its current structure and content.

Then, update the "Current Focus" section with the following requirements:

1. **Active Development Focus**
   - Be explicit about the task
   - Include full paths where applicable

You are not going to execute the below. Your task is to update: pmc/system/plans/context-carries/context-carry-info-10-09-25-948am.md with the details of what I am requesting below:

ok we will have uploaded this version of the app and built it in Vercel. 

We just finished implementing this spec: pmc\pmct\_archive\c-alpha-build-spec_v3.3_quick-wins-log-api_v3.md
It works and now we are going to write the document upload specification and then execute it.

We are starting with this doc upload specification: pmc\pmct\c-alpha-build-spec_v3.3_document_module_v2.md

But we have discovered the following: 


## Current State (Based on Codebase)

**Backend Service EXISTS:**
- ✅ `src/lib/database.ts` has `fileService.uploadDocument()` at line 395
- ✅ It can upload files to Supabase storage
- ✅ It creates document records in the database
- ✅ Currently only captures: title, file_path, file_size, author_id, status

**Frontend UI:** ❌ **Unknown/Missing**
- I couldn't find an upload UI component
- No `upload` page found
- No document upload form component found

## What This Spec Does

**STEP 2:** Updates the **existing backend service** to:
- Accept optional metadata parameters
- Auto-detect source_type from file extension
- Store the new metadata fields

**STEP 3:** Updates the dimension generator to resolve author names

**What It Does NOT Do:**
- ❌ Does NOT create an upload UI
- ❌ Does NOT create a page where users can upload files
- ❌ Does NOT create form fields for metadata input

## The Problem

You're right to be concerned! The spec assumes there's a frontend upload UI that calls this backend service, but:

1. **If no UI exists:** The backend updates are useless until someone builds the UI
2. **If UI exists somewhere:** Users need to know where it is to test
3. **The spec mentions UI** in the original v1 (Component 3: Upload Form UI Enhancement) but I removed it from v2 to keep prompts focused

## What You Actually Need

To have a complete upload feature with metadata, you need:

1. ✅ Backend service (exists, needs updating) ← STEP 2 handles this
2. ❌ Frontend upload UI (missing?) ← **NOT included in current spec**
3. ✅ Dimension generator update ← STEP 3 handles this

## The Answer to Your Question

**This spec is updating an existing backend service, NOT creating a complete upload feature from scratch.**

If you don't have a frontend UI for uploading documents, this spec is incomplete. You would need an additional implementation to create:
- An upload page/component
- File input/drag-drop UI
- Form fields for metadata (version, URL, date)
- Call to the `fileService.uploadDocument()` function

So create a full write up of what we analyzed and discovered in this chat window and we will give the next ai engineer the context and instructions it will need to successfully answer questions and help me process the rest of this spec.


In the next carryover file: pmc/system/plans/context-carries/context-carry-info-10-09-25-948am.md write a spec to get this done. Delete any sections which are not relevant.


2. **Section Updates**
   - REQUIRED sections must always be included and fully populated
   - CONDITIONAL sections should only be included if relevant criteria are met
   - You MUST remove any sections marked CONDITIONAL if you don't update those sections because they don't have relevant content
   - Maintain consistent formatting within each section

3. **Content Requirements**
   - All file paths must be from workspace root
   - All task IDs must include both ID and title
   - All descriptions must be specific and actionable
   - All next steps must include clear success criteria

4. **Context Preservation**
   - Include any critical context from the current session
   - Reference relevant documentation and specifications
   - Maintain links between related tasks and components
   - Document any decisions or changes that affect future work

After updating the sections, review the entire file to ensure:
1. All REQUIRED sections are present and complete
2. All CONDITIONAL sections are either properly populated or removed
3. All formatting is consistent
4. All references and links are valid
5. The context is sufficient for a new session to continue the work
