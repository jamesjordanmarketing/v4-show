## 📋 Project Context

### System Overview

This is a **LoRA training data generation pipeline** for financial advisor conversation simulations:

1. **Scaffolding**: Personas, Emotional Arcs, Training Topics stored in Supabase
2. **Templates**: Prompt templates with `{{placeholder}}` syntax
3. **Batch Jobs**: Process multiple conversations via polling (Vercel serverless limit workaround)
4. **Generation**: Claude API generates structured conversation JSON
5. **Storage**: Supabase Storage for JSON files, PostgreSQL for metadata
6. **Enrichment**: Transform raw JSON into training pairs with metadata
7. **Export**: Training data export for LoRA fine-tuning
8. **Training Files UI**: ✅ **IMPLEMENTED THIS SESSION** - UI for creating and managing aggregated training files

## 🚨 CRITICAL: SAOL Tool Usage (MUST READ)

**You MUST use the Supabase Agent Ops Library (SAOL) for ALL database operations in scripts.**

**Library Path**: `C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\brun\v4-show\supa-agent-ops\`
**Quick Start**: `C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\brun\v4-show\supa-agent-ops\QUICK_START.md`

### ✅ CORRECT SAOL Usage Pattern

```javascript
// ✅ CORRECT IMPORT (in scripts/ folder)
require('../load-env.js'); 
const saol = require('../supa-agent-ops/dist/index.js');

// ✅ Query data
const result = await saol.agentQuery({
  table: 'conversations',
  supabaseUrl: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL,
  supabaseKey: process.env.SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY,
  select: ['id', 'file_path', 'enriched_file_path'],
  limit: 5,
  transport: 'supabase'  // CRITICAL: Use 'supabase' transport (not 'pg')
});
```

### ⚠️ SAOL Limitations Discovered in Prompt 1 Session

1. **DDL Operations**: `agentExecuteSQL` with DDL (CREATE TABLE, etc.) encounters validation errors
   - **Workaround**: Use SQL paste method into Supabase SQL Editor
   - **Status**: SAOL migration scripts exist but are experimental

2. **Environment Variables**: SAOL requires specific env var setup
   - `transport: 'pg'` requires `DATABASE_URL` (connection string)
   - `transport: 'supabase'` requires `SUPABASE_URL` and `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`
   - **Issue**: dotenv integration in SAOL scripts needs adjustment

3. **Recommended Approach**:
   - **Migrations**: Use SQL paste method (most reliable)
   - **Validation**: Use direct Supabase client or SQL queries
   - **Data Operations**: Use SAOL for queries, counts, inserts, updates

### Quick Database Query Commands

```bash
# Query conversations with enriched files
node -e "require('./load-env.js'); const { createClient } = require('@supabase/supabase-js'); const supabase = createClient(process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL, process.env.SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY); (async () => { const { data } = await supabase.from('conversations').select('id, file_path, enriched_file_path, enrichment_status').not('enriched_file_path', 'is', null).limit(5); console.log(JSON.stringify(data, null, 2)); })();"

# Check existing storage buckets
node -e "require('./load-env.js'); const { createClient } = require('@supabase/supabase-js'); const supabase = createClient(process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL, process.env.SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY); (async () => { const { data } = await supabase.storage.listBuckets(); console.log('Buckets:', data.map(b => b.name)); })();"

# Count training files
node -e "require('./load-env.js'); const { createClient } = require('@supabase/supabase-js'); const supabase = createClient(process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL, process.env.SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY); (async () => { const { count } = await supabase.from('training_files').select('*', { count: 'exact', head: true }); console.log('Training files:', count); })();"
```

## 🎯 NEXT AGENT PRIMARY TASKS

### Task 1: Manual UI Testing (HIGH PRIORITY - START HERE)

**Objective**: Verify the complete UI works end-to-end with real user interactions.

**Prerequisites**:
- Development server running
- At least 3-5 conversations with `enrichment_status='completed'` and `enriched_file_path` not null
- User authenticated in the application

**Test Sequence**:

#### Step 1: Verify Empty State
```bash

cd C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\brun\v4-show\src
npm run dev

# 2. Navigate to http://localhost:3000/training-files
# Expected: Empty state card with:
#   - FileJson icon
#   - "No training files yet"
#   - "Create your first training file from the Conversations page"
```

#### Step 2: Test Training File Creation
```bash
# 1. Navigate to http://localhost:3000/conversations
# 2. Select 3 conversations using checkboxes
# 3. Verify selection banner appears showing "3 conversations selected"

#    - Name: "Test Training File Alpha"
#    - Description: "My first test training file"
#    - Conversations: 3
#    - Training Pairs: (some number > 0)
#    - Avg Quality: (badge with score if available)
#    - Distribution: persona/arc/topic counts
#    - Files: JSON and JSONL sizes
#    - Created: "a few seconds ago" or similar
#    - Actions: Two buttons (JSON, JSONL)
```

#### Step 4: Test JSON Download
```bash

#    - Button shows loading/disabled state briefly
#    - New tab opens with signed URL
#    - File downloads automatically or prompts to save
#    - Toast notification: "Downloading <filename>.jsonl"
# 3. Open downloaded file and verify:
#    - Each line is a complete JSON object (no pretty printing)
#    - Lines separated by newlines
#    - Each line represents one training pair
#    - Count of lines matches total_training_pairs from table
```

#### Step 6: Test Adding to Existing File
```bash
# 1. Navigate to http://localhost:3000/conversations
# 2. Select 2 DIFFERENT conversations (not already in training file)
# 3. Click "Create Training Files" button
# 4. Verify dropdown shows:
#    - "Create New Training File"
#    - Separator
#    - "Existing Files" label

# 2. Expected: "Test Training File Alpha" now shows:
#    - Conversations: 5 (was 3)
#    - Training Pairs: (increased count)
#    - Updated timestamp changed
```

#### Step 8: Test Duplicate Conversation Error
```bash
# 1. Navigate to http://localhost:3000/conversations
# 2. Select one conversation that's already in "Test Training File Alpha"
# 3. Click "Create Training Files"
# 4. Click on "Test Training File Alpha"
# 5. Expected:
#    - Toast error notification
#    - Message includes "already exists" or similar
#    - No changes to training file
```

#### Step 9: Test Empty Name Validation
```bash
# 1. Navigate to http://localhost:3000/conversations
# 2. Select conversations
# 3. Click "Create Training Files" → "Create New Training File"
# 4. Leave name field blank
# 5. Click "Create Training File" button
# 6. Expected:
#    - Toast error: "Please enter a file name"
#    - Dialog remains open
#    - No API call made
```

#### Step 10: Test Navigation Links
```bash
# 1. Navigate to http://localhost:3000/dashboard
# 2. Verify "Training Files" button exists in header (green, with FileJson icon)
# 3. Click button
# 4. Expected: Navigate to /training-files

# 5. Navigate to http://localhost:3000/conversations
# 6. Verify "Training Files" button exists in header (green outlined)
# 7. Click button
# 8. Expected: Navigate to /training-files
```

#### Step 11: Test Non-Completed Conversation Blocking
```bash
# 1. Verify you have conversations with enrichment_status != 'completed'
# 2. Try to add them to a training file
# 3. Expected: API returns error (handled by service layer)
# 4. Toast error notification appears
```

#### Step 12: Test Loading States
```bash
# 1. On /training-files page, click Refresh button
# 2. Expected: Brief loading state shows "Loading training files..."
# 3. On slow network, create training file
# 4. Expected: "Create Training File" button shows "Creating..."
# 5. On slow network, download file
# 6. Expected: Download button appears disabled during request
```

#### Step 13: Test Error Handling
```bash
# 1. Stop the development server (simulate network error)
# 2. Try to create a training file
# 3. Expected: Toast error notification with network error message
# 4. Try to download a file
# 5. Expected: Toast error notification
```

### Task 2: API Endpoint Testing (SUPPLEMENTAL)

**Status**: API endpoints implemented in Prompt 1, verified working. UI testing above will test these indirectly.

**Direct API Testing** (optional if UI testing reveals issues):

```bash
# Get JWT token first (login to app, inspect network tab for Authorization header)
# Or get from Supabase Dashboard → Authentication → Users → (select user)

# Test: List training files
curl -X GET http://localhost:3000/api/training-files \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN"

# Test: Create training file
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/training-files \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN" \
  -d '{
    "name": "api_test_batch",
    "description": "Created via API",
    "conversation_ids": ["uuid1", "uuid2", "uuid3"]
  }'

# Test: Add conversations to existing file
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/training-files/FILE_ID/add-conversations \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN" \
  -d '{
    "conversation_ids": ["uuid4", "uuid5"]
  }'

# Test: Get download URL
curl -X GET "http://localhost:3000/api/training-files/FILE_ID/download?format=json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN"
```

### Task 3: Cross-Browser Testing (LOWER PRIORITY)

**After UI testing passes on Chrome**:

1. Test on Firefox
2. Test on Safari (if on Mac)
3. Test on Edge

**Key areas to verify**:
- Dialog animations work
- Dropdown menu positioning
- File downloads work correctly
- Toast notifications display properly

### Task 4: Documentation Updates (IF NEEDED)

**Only update if issues found**:

1. Update `C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\brun\v4-show\PROMPT_2_FILE_1_COMPLETION.md` with any changes
2. Update `C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\brun\v4-show\docs\TRAINING_FILES_QUICK_START.md` if UI patterns change
3. Create bug report document if issues found

## 🔍 Implementation Details from This Session

### TypeScript Interfaces Used

```typescript
interface TrainingFile {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  description: string | null;
  conversation_count: number;
  total_training_pairs: number;
  json_file_size: number | null;
  jsonl_file_size: number | null;
  avg_quality_score: number | null;
  scaffolding_distribution: {
    personas: Record<string, number>;
    emotional_arcs: Record<string, number>;
    training_topics: Record<string, number>;
  };
  status: string;
  created_at: string;
}
```

### React Query Integration

**Queries**:
- `['training-files']` - Fetches all training files for list page
- `['training-files']` - Fetches all training files for dropdown (only when conversations selected)

**Mutations**:
- `createTrainingFileMutation` - Creates new training file
  - Input: `{ name: string, description?: string, conversation_ids: string[] }`
  - On success: Invalidates queries, clears selection, closes dialog, shows toast
  - On error: Shows toast with error message
- `addToTrainingFileMutation` - Adds conversations to existing file
  - Input: `{ training_file_id: string, conversation_ids: string[] }`
  - On success: Invalidates queries, clears selection, shows toast
  - On error: Shows toast with error message

### State Management

**ConversationTable Component State**:
```typescript
const [showCreateTrainingFileDialog, setShowCreateTrainingFileDialog] = useState(false);
const [newFileName, setNewFileName] = useState('');
const [newFileDescription, setNewFileDescription] = useState('');
const [selectedTrainingFileId, setSelectedTrainingFileId] = useState<string | null>(null);
```

**Training Files Page State**:
```typescript
const [downloadingId, setDownloadingId] = useState<string | null>(null);
const [downloadFormat, setDownloadFormat] = useState<'json' | 'jsonl' | null>(null);
```

### API Endpoints Consumed by UI

1. **GET `/api/training-files`**
   - Used by: Training files page, dropdown in conversations table
   - Returns: `{ files: TrainingFile[] }`
   - Error handling: Displays error card on page, shows toast on dropdown

2. **POST `/api/training-files`**
   - Used by: Create training file dialog
   - Body: `{ name: string, description?: string, conversation_ids: string[] }`
   - Returns: Created training file object
   - Error handling: Shows toast with API error message

3. **POST `/api/training-files/:id/add-conversations`**
   - Used by: Dropdown menu when clicking existing file
   - Body: `{ conversation_ids: string[] }`
   - Returns: Updated training file object
   - Error handling: Shows toast with API error message (includes duplicate detection)

4. **GET `/api/training-files/:id/download?format=json|jsonl`**
   - Used by: Download buttons on training files page
   - Query params: `format` (json or jsonl)
   - Returns: `{ download_url: string, filename: string }`
   - Behavior: Opens signed URL in new tab
   - Error handling: Shows toast on failure

### Styling Decisions

1. **Color Scheme**:
   - Green theme for Training Files feature (matching "Generate New" button style)
   - Selection banner: Muted background (`bg-muted/50`)
   - Error states: Red border (`border-red-200`)
   - Loading states: Disabled buttons with loading text

2. **Icons** (all from lucide-react):
   - `FileJson` - Training files feature
   - `Plus` - Create new actions
   - `Download` - Download actions
   - `FileText` - JSONL files

3. **Layout**:
   - Selection banner: `p-4 bg-muted/50 rounded-md border` with flex layout
   - Table: Card-based with CardHeader and CardContent
   - Dialog: Standard Dialog component from shadcn/ui
   - Dropdown: Max-width 64 (`w-64`) with scroll for many files

4. **Responsive Design**:
   - Container with `mx-auto` on training files page
   - Table with horizontal scroll on small screens (default behavior)
   - Dialog responsive (handled by shadcn/ui)
