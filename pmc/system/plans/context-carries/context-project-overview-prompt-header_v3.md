### What This Application Does

**Bright Run LoRA Training Data Platform** - A Next.js 14 application that generates high-quality AI training conversations for fine-tuning large language models. The platform enables non-technical domain experts to transform proprietary knowledge into LoRA-ready training datasets and execute GPU training jobs.

**Core Capabilities**:
1. **Conversation Generation**: AI-powered generation using Claude API with predetermined field structure.
2. **Enrichment Pipeline**: 5-stage validation and enrichment for quality assurance.
3. **Storage System**: File storage (Supabase Storage) + metadata (PostgreSQL).
4. **Management Dashboard**: UI for reviewing, downloading, and managing conversations.
5. **Download System**: Export both raw and enriched JSON formats.
6. **LoRA Training Pipeline**: Database, API routes, UI, training engine & evaluation.
7. **Adapter Download System**: Download trained adapter files as tar.gz archives.
8. **Automated Adapter Testing**: RunPod Pods (working) + Serverless (preserved).
9. **Multi-Turn Chat Testing**: A/B testing, RQE evaluation, dual progress.
10. **RAG Frontier**: Knowledge base management, document upload, multi-doc context assembly, HyDE + hybrid search, self-evaluation.
11. **Automated Adapter Deployment**: (FULLY FUNCTIONAL as of Session 8) - Pushes trained adapters to Hugging Face and hot-loads them into RunPod serverless endpoints.
12. **Work Base Architecture (v4-show)**: Every operation is scoped to a `workbase` entity. Routes at `/workbase/[id]/fine-tuning/*` and `/workbase/[id]/fact-training/*`.
