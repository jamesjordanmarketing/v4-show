## 🚀 PHASE 1: FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS GENERATION

### STEP 1.1: Generate Initial Functional Requirements

**Script:** `03-generate-FR-initial.js`  
**Purpose:** Convert user stories into initial functional requirements structure

**Command:**
```bash
cd pmc/product/_tools
node 03-generate-FR-initial.js "Project Name" project-abbrev
```

**Example:**
```bash
node 03-generate-FR-initial.js "Bright Run" bmo
```

**What it does:**
- Reads `02-bmo-user-stories.md`
- Generates initial `03-bmo-functional-requirements.md`
- Creates basic FR structure with US references
- Sets up skeleton for enhancement process

**Expected Output:**
- File created: `03-bmo-functional-requirements.md`
- Console: "Functional requirements generated successfully"

### STEP 1.2: Enhance Functional Requirements (Interactive)

**Script:** `03-generate-functional-requirements.js`  
**Purpose:** Two-step enhancement with journey integration and persona consolidation

**Command:**
```bash
node 03-generate-functional-requirements.js "Project Name" project-abbrev
```

**Example:**
```bash
node 03-generate-functional-requirements.js "Bright Run" bmo
```

**Interactive Process:**

#### **Step 1.2a: Preprocessing Phase**
The script will prompt for file paths:

1. **FR Preprocessing Instructions:** Press Enter for default
   - Uses: `_prompt_engineering/3a-preprocess-functional-requirements-prompt_v1.md`

2. **Initial Functional Requirements:** Press Enter for default
   - Uses: `03-bmo-functional-requirements.md`

3. **Project Overview:** Press Enter for default
   - Uses: `01-bmo-overview.md`

4. **User Stories:** Press Enter for default
   - Uses: `02-bmo-user-stories.md`

**What preprocessing does:**
- Removes non-product requirements
- Eliminates duplicate requirements
- Reorders by build dependencies
- **Consolidates persona-specific requirements** (NEW)
- Applies journey integration rules (NEW)

#### **Step 1.2b: Enhancement Phase**
After preprocessing completes, continue to enhancement:

5. **Reference Example:** Press Enter for default
   - Uses: `_examples/03-bmo-functional-requirements.md`

6. **Include codebase review?** Type `n` (unless you have legacy code)

**What enhancement does:**
- Adds detailed acceptance criteria
- **Integrates user journey elements** (NEW)
- Maps FRs to journey stages 1-6
- Applies progressive disclosure levels
- **Consolidates all persona criteria** (NEW)

**Expected Output:**
- Enhanced prompts in: `_prompt_engineering/output-prompts/`
- Console: "Journey data integration applied"
- Console: "All prompts generated successfully!"

## 🎨 PHASE 2: WIREFRAME PROMPT GENERATION

### STEP 2.1: Generate Stage-Specific Wireframe Prompts

**Script:** `04-generate-FR-wireframe-segments_v4.js`  
**Purpose:** Create journey-enhanced wireframe prompts for all stages

**Command:**
```bash
node 04-generate-FR-wireframe-segments_v4.js "Project Name" project-abbrev
```

**Example:**
```bash
node 04-generate-FR-wireframe-segments_v4.js "Bright Run" bmo
```

**What it does:**
- Parses enhanced functional requirements
- Extracts FRs by stage (E01-E06)
- **Integrates journey data per stage** (NEW)
- Generates stage-specific wireframe prompts
- **Adds emotional design requirements** (NEW)
- **Includes progressive disclosure levels** (NEW)

**Expected Output:**
```
