# Analysis: Comparison of Two Task Generation Prompt Systems

## Executive Summary

This analysis compares two prompt engineering files and their corresponding JavaScript tools:

1. **04-FR-with-wireframes-create-tasks_v1.md** + **04-generate-FR-wireframe-segments_v4.js**
2. **06a-product-task-elements-breakdown-prompt-v6.0-v5.md** + **06b-generate-task-prompt-segments-5.4.js**

**Key Finding**: Both systems break down Functional Requirements (FRs) into development tasks, but with different approaches and granularity:

- **04-FR-with-wireframes**: Generates comprehensive feature and function task inventories from wireframes and requirements
- **06a-product-task-elements**: Generates atomic, granular task breakdowns using the IPDM methodology

**Important Correction**: The 04-FR system does NOT generate Figma prompts. The JavaScript tool `04-generate-FR-wireframe-segments_v4.js` uses the prompt template to generate task lists, not wireframe prompts.

## Recommendation for Modular Prompt Execution Philosophy

**Question**: Which task generation system is better suited for a modular prompt execution approach using self-contained 200k token context windows in Claude-4.5-sonnet?

**Answer**: **04-FR-with-wireframes-create-tasks_v1.md** is significantly better suited for this approach.

### Reasoning:

**Why 04-FR-with-wireframes is Superior for Modular Execution:**

1. **Self-Contained Feature Scope**: 
   - Generates 50-200 broader feature-level tasks that naturally contain complete functionality
   - Each task encompasses full-stack implementation (frontend, backend, database) in one cohesive unit
   - Reduces the risk of agents losing context since each prompt contains a complete feature scope

2. **Optimal Token Utilization**:
   - Broader tasks make better use of 200k token context windows
   - Less fragmentation means more complete context per prompt
   - Fewer total prompts needed to complete the entire project

3. **Reduced Interdependencies**:
   - Feature-level tasks are more naturally independent
   - Less coordination required between successive prompts
   - Each prompt can be executed without waiting for prior components to finish

4. **Complete Context Preservation**:
   - Comprehensive analysis framework ensures all necessary context is included
   - Full-stack coverage prevents missing integration points
   - Production readiness criteria included in each task scope

**Why 06a-product-task-elements is Less Suitable:**

1. **Excessive Granularity**:
   - 2-4 hour atomic tasks would require dozens of separate prompts
   - High risk of context loss across many small interactions
   - Inefficient use of 200k token context windows

2. **Complex Dependencies**:
   - IPDM's 6-stage sequential pipeline creates tight interdependencies
   - Subsequent prompts would need completion of prior stages
   - Violates the modular execution principle

3. **Context Fragmentation**:
   - Atomic tasks lose sight of broader feature goals
   - Agents may optimize locally while missing global objectives
   - Requires careful orchestration across many prompts

### Implementation Strategy for 04-FR-with-wireframes:

**Recommended Approach**:
1. Use `04-generate-FR-wireframe-segments_v4.js` to generate feature-level task prompts
2. Each generated prompt file (`04-FR-wireframes-prompt-E[XX].md`) becomes a self-contained 200k token execution unit
3. Include SQL setup steps and complete implementation context in each prompt
4. Structure prompts with clear ======= and +++++++ delimiters for copy-paste sections
5. Ensure each prompt contains all necessary context without external dependencies

**Expected Outcome**:
- 5-15 self-contained prompts (depending on project size) instead of 50+ granular tasks
- Each prompt delivers complete, testable features
- Minimal coordination required between prompt executions
- Better preservation of feature context and user experience goals

**Conclusion**: The 04-FR-with-wireframes system aligns perfectly with the modular prompt execution philosophy by generating appropriately-scoped, self-contained tasks that make optimal use of large context windows while preserving feature coherence.

2. **Identify Dependencies**: Map out which tasks depend on others and must be completed sequentially
3. **Assess Risk Factors**: Identify tasks with highest implementation risk and plan mitigation strategies
4. **Optimize for Context Windows**: Group related tasks to maximize the value of each 200k token prompt
5. **Plan for Quality**: Ensure each prompt includes comprehensive validation and testing instructions

### Context Examination Requirements
You must thoroughly examine:

1. **Previous Segment Outputs**: Understand what has been built and what this segment builds upon
2. **Existing Codebase State**: Analyze current implementation to avoid conflicts and leverage existing patterns
3. **Cross-Task Dependencies**: Identify shared components, data models, and integration points
