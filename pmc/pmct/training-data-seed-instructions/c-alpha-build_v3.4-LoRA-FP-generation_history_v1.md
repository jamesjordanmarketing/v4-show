# Input Prompt

Read the bmo overview document in the project files here: `C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\brun\v4-show\pmc\product\01-bmo-overview.md` you will understand the product.

For the current project at Bright Run we are going to solve this problem:
"Limited training data: Most corporate chatbots operate on narrower, company-specific datasets, such as FAQs and support documentation, rather than the vast, internet-scale datasets used to train general LLMs. This limits their ability to handle the nuances of natural language and emotional expression." 
Our current prototype ingests unstructured content and turns it into sophisticated LoRA training pairs. 
So for this task we are going to build the definitive JSON data structure for the "Emotionally Sensitive" large dataset that we are creating.
We must also build the taxonomy and seed documents:
The final version of our launch JSON Emotionally Aware Training Data Format & Structure
Emotional states taxonomy with full values (separate file)
Response strategies taxonomy (separate file)
Persona/voice guidelines (separate file)

A data filled seed JSON document with synthetically created data based on the seed Emotionally Aware chat bot for customers of Financial Planners 
The purpose of this LoRA fine-tuning data training data is to powerfully train modern LLMs to engage in emotionally aware conversations. The first launch product is to create a large data set that uses the latest training data formats and techniques, used by the leaders in the commercial field, of which you are one. 

The critical deliverable for this task is the INPUT data set that we will use to train an LLM using LoRA. We need a JSON format that will be used as input for LoRA training.  This input needs to train the LLM how to handle deep context, like multi turn conversations and also train it on how to adjust emotional responses to current steps in a conversation. 
We will use a seed persona and example for the financial planner customer vertical. You must read this full financial planner seed document here: `C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\brun\v4-show\system\chunks-alpha-data\financial-planner-demo-conversation-and-metadata_v1.txt`
Design and create for me a JSON format that will explicitly define the range of emotional states we want the chatbot to recognize (e.g., frustration, anxiety, relief, gratitude) and the corresponding empathetic response. Use emotion taxonomy Goleman's model of EI to guide your labels. It should be a full dataset format. Meaning it should have all fields that defines the training set (not just emotional ones). Pretend that it is a dataset format for a customer service chat at one of the cutting edge emotional data set creators in the world in 2025.
That is key to our product we know longer prioritize 2023 models of LoRA training. We are creating datasets that are training the modern ("October 2025 LoRA emotional intelligence training advances" look this up), LoRA training practices, abilities, structures, and processes. 
The first job then is to define the JSON data structure for this large training input dataset.
----------------------------

Here are our notes on how to create a dataset for emotionally sensitive responses.
From Example Conversations to LoRA Training Data Format
You're asking the critical question: How do we structure the actual INPUT format that trains the model to produce those conversations?
The Key Conceptual Shift
What you showed me: Example output (what we want the chatbot to say AFTER training)
What you need: Training input pairs that teach the model HOW to generate those responses
LoRA Training Data Structure for Emotional Intelligence
For LoRA fine-tuning with emotional intelligence and multi-turn context, you need a format that teaches the model:
Pattern recognition: Recognize emotional cues in user text
Strategy selection: Choose appropriate response strategies based on emotional state
Response generation: Generate empathetic, contextually-appropriate responses
Context maintenance: Track conversation history and emotional progression
Creating a dataset for emotionally sensitive and kind responses requires gathering and structuring data that models emotional awareness, empathy, and supportive communication. Instead of just question-and-answer pairs, the dataset needs to capture the emotional context of a conversation.
 
Steps for creating the dataset
Define and label emotional states: First, you must explicitly define the range of emotional states you want the chatbot to recognize (e.g., frustration, anxiety, relief, gratitude) and the corresponding empathetic response. You can use emotion taxonomies like Goleman's model of EI to guide your labels.
Gather real-world dialogue data: Source conversational data from your existing customer service channels (transcripts, chat logs), social media interactions, or online forums. Anonymize all data to protect user privacy.
Use synthetic data generation: To address data sparsity and cover a wider range of scenarios, use an LLM to generate synthetic conversations. You can provide a prompt that specifies a user's emotional state and asks the LLM to generate a corresponding empathetic response from a chatbot.
Example synthetic prompt: User: "I've been on hold for 30 minutes and I'm very frustrated."
Desired output format: Chatbot (emotion=calm, tone=empathetic): "I understand your frustration with the wait time. I'm very sorry for the delay."
Incorporate reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF): Once you have a preliminary dataset, use human labelers to rank different chatbot responses based on how empathetic or helpful they seem. The best responses are used to train a preference model, which then fine-tunes your LLM to better align with human expectations of empathetic communication.
Expand with diverse and culturally sensitive examples: Gather data that reflects various conversational styles and cultural norms. Train the LLM to recognize different ways people express emotion. This can help prevent the chatbot from making insensitive assumptions.
Critical Training Data Requirements
To effectively train for emotional intelligence, our dataset needs to be able to:
1. Contain a Diversity of Emotional States
Minimum: 50+ examples of EACH primary emotion (shame, anxiety, frustration, relief, hope, etc.)
Intensity variations: Same emotion at low/medium/high intensity
Emotional progressions: How emotions change across conversation turns
2. Contain Strategy-to-Outcome Patterns
At least 20+ examples of each response strategy (empathic validation, normalizing, reframing, etc.)
Combination strategies: When multiple approaches are used together
Failed strategies: Examples of what NOT to do (optional but helpful)
3. Contain Multi-Turn Context
Short conversations: 2-3 turns (50+ examples)
Medium conversations: 4-6 turns (30+ examples)
Long conversations: 7-10 turns (10+ examples)
4. Contain Persona Consistency
All training examples must maintain the ideal customer's voice and philosophy
Consistent application of "education-first" and "no judgment" principles
Specific phrase patterns that define the brand voice
We must be able to train the conversations for:
Emotional states at each turn
Strategy used in each response
Why each sentence exists (function)
What the model should learn
We must create the JSON training format
We must be able to create variations of the seed data like:
- Same emotion, different topic (customer A: shame about investments → customer B: shame about debt)
- Same topic, different emotion (same question asked with confidence vs. anxiety)
- Same strategy, different context (empathic validation for job loss vs. market crash)
Also for the purpose of training does it make sense for the format to have the ability to "update" or "correct" emotional identifications. I.E. The problem I am trying to solve is that we are going to create initial data sets based on our internal small corpus of customer interactions. These are all text based interactions, so not verbal or visual cues are available. 
So while we will ask the LLM to use it's best patterns to identify emotions in each conversation turn, it will be extremely valuable if our training set is native to, and self healing for, the process of upgrading the emotional state identification based on: human intentional bulk review in the future, or "real time" annotations created by human operators in future chat conversations, or even automated improvement via internal cues that we discover in the future.
This is a huge added value for our customers who will be adopting and adapting this dataset. We will produce the first pass of the actual data, it will be a huge added value if the data set format let them improve  I.E. If the data format has the built in facility to "improve" the data based on multiple input streams.
I mean another way to discuss this is "what is valuable about history". To me such a history seems very valuable. For example if we can run data analysis across our customer corpus and discover that people who say "X" are usually labelled as "emotion Y" based on the semantics and general context. But the history of the text shows that often the chat operator frequently changes the emotion label to "emotion Z". Or even better, in this sub category of service they are actually "emotion A" while other sub categories remain "emotion Y". This kind of ability would make this dataset and format very useful.  Is this something we should build in now? Or is it never applicable to the training corpus?
The format must allow us to use annotated examples as seeds to generate 10-100x variations
We must be able to utilize human review for quality and emotional authenticity

Write that document here: `C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\brun\v4-show\pmc\pmct\c-alpha-build_v3.4_emotional-dataset-seed-live_v1.md`
Future Improvements:
1. How to interface the emotional dataset as a "layer" or "add-on" over an existing LoRA trained system. This has serve a slightly different purpose with a similar affect. Instead of fine tuning a customer service LLM with a training set embedded with seed questions, business verticals, etc, what type of data set would be a customer content agnostic but functions as a layer either at chat time, or at other contexts & training times?

# Prompt Opus 4.1 response
# Next Steps: Producing 100 Primary Multi-Turn Conversations for Financial Planner Emotional AI

## Project Phase Overview

We've completed the **foundational architecture** (JSON format, taxonomies, and seed examples). Now we need to move to **scaled data generation** - creating 100 high-quality, multi-turn conversations that fully populate our sophisticated JSON structure.

## The Challenge

Creating 100 conversations means:
- **~800-1,200 individual turns** (assuming 8-12 turns per conversation)
- **Complete emotional annotation** for each turn
- **Realistic progression patterns** across conversations
- **Diverse scenarios** covering the financial planning domain
- **Consistent persona voice** (Elena Morales, CFP®)
- **Therapeutic validity** in all responses

## Proposed Approach: Hybrid Generation Pipeline

### Step 1: Scenario Matrix Development (Week 1)

Create a comprehensive matrix covering:

#### Financial Topics (25 categories)
- Retirement planning (401k, IRA, Roth conversions)
- Debt management (credit cards, student loans, mortgages)
- Emergency funds & cash reserves
- Investment basics & portfolio allocation
- Insurance planning (life, disability, long-term care)
- Tax planning & optimization
- Estate planning basics
- College savings (529 plans)
- Home buying decisions
- Career transitions & income changes
- Small business finances
- Divorce financial planning
- Inheritance management
- Healthcare costs planning
- Social Security optimization

#### Emotional Starting Points (8 primary states)
- Shame/Embarrassment about financial illiteracy
- Anxiety about future security
- Overwhelm from too many options
- Anger about past mistakes or betrayals
- Grief from financial loss
- Hope for improvement
- Confusion about complex topics
- Fear of making wrong decisions

#### User Personas (20 archetypes)
Based on the three seed personas, expand to include:
- Age ranges: 25-30, 31-40, 41-50, 51-60, 60+
- Income levels: Low ($30-50k), Middle ($50-100k), Upper-middle ($100-200k), High ($200k+)
- Life situations: Single, married, divorced, widowed, with/without children
- Financial literacy levels: None, basic, intermediate, conflicting information
- Cultural backgrounds: Various approaches to money

This creates a matrix of **25 × 8 × 20 = 4,000 possible combinations**, from which we'll select 100 representative scenarios.

# Proposed Pipeline Architecture

class ConversationGenerator:
    def __init__(self):
        self.scenario_matrix = load_scenario_matrix()
        self.persona_bank = load_personas()
        self.elena_model = load_consultant_model()
        
    def generate_conversation(self, scenario_id):
        # 1. Select scenario from matrix
        scenario = self.scenario_matrix.get(scenario_id)
        
        # 2. Generate opening with emotional state
        opening = self.generate_opening(
            topic=scenario.topic,
            emotion=scenario.emotion,
            persona=scenario.persona
        )
        
        # 3. Generate Elena's response with strategies
        response = self.generate_consultant_response(
            input=opening,
            emotional_state=scenario.emotion,
            strategies=self.select_strategies(scenario.emotion)
        )
        
        # 4. Simulate emotional progression
        next_emotion = self.predict_emotional_progression(
            current=scenario.emotion,
            response_strategies=response.strategies
        )
        
        # 5. Continue for 8-12 turns
        conversation = self.build_full_conversation(
            opening, response, target_turns=10
        )
        
        # 6. Add complete annotations

## Proposed Generation Strategy

### Phase 1: Template-Based Generation (Week 1-2)
Create 30 conversations using structured templates:

```json
{
  "template": "debt_shame_resolution",
  "variables": {
    "debt_amount": [5000, 15000, 30000, 50000],
    "debt_type": ["credit_card", "student_loan", "medical", "business"],
    "persona_age": [28, 35, 45, 55],
    "emotional_intensity": [0.5, 0.7, 0.9]
  }
}
```

### Phase 2: Scenario-Driven Generation (Week 2-3)
Create 40 conversations from specific scenarios:

```json
{
  "scenario": "inherited_money_guilt",
  "setup": "User inherited $200k from parent, feels guilty about spending",
  "emotional_arc": "guilt → understanding → empowerment",
  "key_learnings": ["values_clarification", "honoring_legacy", "permission_to_thrive"]
}
```

### Phase 3: Edge Case Generation (Week 3-4)
Create 30 conversations for complex situations:

```json
{
  "edge_case": "divorce_financial_trauma",
  "complexity": "high",
  "emotions": ["betrayal", "fear", "anger", "determination"],
  "special_considerations": ["trauma-informed", "boundary-setting", "rebuilding_trust"]
}
```

## Deliverable Format

Each conversation will be delivered as:

1. **Full JSON file** following our schema
2. **Human-readable summary** with key emotional moments
3. **Quality scorecard** with validation metrics
4. **Synthetic expansion notes** for generating variations

## Timeline

- **Week 1**: Scenario matrix creation, template development
- **Week 2**: Generate first 30 conversations, initial review
- **Week 3**: Generate next 40 conversations, expert validation
- **Week 4**: Generate final 30 conversations, edge cases
- **Week 5**: Quality review, corrections, final annotations
- **Week 6**: Synthetic expansion testing, delivery

## Critical Success Factors

1. **Emotional Authenticity**: Every conversation must feel genuine
2. **Financial Accuracy**: All advice must be professionally sound
3. **Therapeutic Validity**: Responses must be ethically appropriate
4. **Diversity Coverage**: Full range of personas and situations
5. **Consistency**: Elena's voice remains steady throughout

## Next Immediate Steps

To proceed, I need you to:

1. **Provide or approve access to**:
   - Any existing conversation examples (even if modified)
   - List of most common financial planning scenarios in your experience
   - Target demographic information for the chatbot users
   - Any specific compliance or regulatory constraints

2. **Decide on**:
   - Whether to use automated generation with human review
   - Budget for API costs and human annotation
   - Timeline flexibility (6 weeks optimal vs. rushed)
   - Quality vs. quantity trade-offs

3. **Confirm**:
   - The 100 conversations can be distributed across the scenario matrix
   - Elena Morales remains the consistent assistant persona
   - The financial planning domain focus (vs. general financial advice)
   - The emotional complexity level (current schema is quite sophisticated)

With these resources and decisions, I can begin generating the first batch of 10 conversations for review, allowing us to refine the process before scaling to the full 100.

**Would you like me to:**
1. Start with a smaller pilot batch (10 conversations) to test the pipeline?
2. Create more detailed templates for specific scenario types?
3. Develop the automated validation tools first?
4. Generate synthetic variations of the 3 existing seed conversations?

The most efficient path would be to start with option 1 - create 10 diverse conversations that we can review together, refining our approach before committing to the full 100.
