## Process Overview

This document provides a **standardized, repeatable workflow** for producing conversations 11-100. The same basic steps apply to all three tiers (Template-Driven, Scenario-Based, Edge Cases), with variations noted for each tier.

**Total Process:**
- 90 conversations to produce (conversations 11-100)
- Organized in batches of 5-10 conversations
- Each batch follows identical process steps
- ~10-12 batches total across 14 weeks

## Phase Structure

```
SETUP PHASE (One-time)
└─ Steps S1-S3 (8 hours total)

PRODUCTION PHASE (Repeatable)
└─ Steps P1-P10 per batch (12-16 hours per batch)
   ├─ Execute 10-12 times for 90 conversations
   └─ Each batch produces 5-10 conversations

COMPLETION PHASE (One-time)
└─ Steps C1-C4 (12 hours total)

TOTAL: ~180-200 hours over 14 weeks
```

---

## SETUP PHASE (One-Time, Before Starting Production)

### Step S1: Project Infrastructure Setup (2 hours)

**Objective:** Create organizational structure for tracking and managing 90 new conversations

**Prerequisites:**
- Phase 1 complete (10 conversations exist)
- Budget approved
- Expert reviewers identified

**Actions:**

1. **Create Folder Structure**
   ```
   /pmct/
   ├─ tier1-template/ (conversations 11-50)
   │  ├─ batch-01/ (conversations 11-15)
   │  ├─ batch-02/ (conversations 16-20)
   │  └─ ... (8 batches total)
   ├─ tier2-scenario/ (conversations 51-85)
   │  └─ batch-01 through batch-07/
   ├─ tier3-edge/ (conversations 86-100)
   │  └─ batch-01 through batch-03/
   └─ quality-review/
      ├─ batch-tracking.xlsx
      └─ review-notes/
   ```

2. **Create Tracking Spreadsheet** (`pmc\pmct\quality-review\batch-tracking.csv`)
   - Columns: Batch #, Conversation IDs, Tier, Status, Generation Date, Review Date, Quality Score, Reviewer, Notes
   - Pre-populate with conversation IDs 11-100

   - Add status dropdown: Planning, Generating, Review, Revisions, Complete
      - James will manually convert the status to a drop down when the file is uploaded to Google.

3. **Set Up Communication Channels**
   - Create shared folder for expert reviewers
   - Schedule recurring weekly review meetings
   - Establish Slack/email channel for questions

**Outputs:**
- ✅ Folder structure created
- ✅ Tracking spreadsheet initialized
- ✅ Communication channels established

**Time Estimate:** 2 hours

### Step S2: Template & Scenario Design Document (4 hours)

**Objective:** Create master specification document for all 90 conversations

**Prerequisites:**
- Step S1 complete
- Access to Phase 1 conversations (1-10)
- Tier strategy document reviewed

I have changed this to be separate files for each scenario. So:

**Actions:**

1. **Create Master Scenario Matrix** (as local CSV in pmc\pmct\quality-review\)
   - **Tier 1 file named:** master-scenario-matrix-tier-1_v1: 40 rows (conversations 11-50)
     - Columns: Conv ID, Template Type (A-E), Topic, Persona Age, Persona Income, Emotional Start, Emotional End, Turn Count, Key Learning Objective, Notes
   - **Tier 2 file named:** master-scenario-matrix-tier-2_v1: 35 rows (conversations 51-85)
     - Columns: Conv ID, Scenario Name, Complexity Level, Topic Category, Primary Emotions, Special Considerations, Turn Count, Expert Review Required (Finance/Therapy/Legal), Notes
   - **Tier 3 file named:** master-scenario-matrix-tier-3_v1: 15 rows (conversations 86-100)
     - Columns: Conv ID, Edge Case Type, Boundary Being Tested, Referral Type, Crisis Level, Turn Count, Legal Review Required, Notes

So after creating the Master Scenario Matrix we will have 3 new files:
pmc\pmct\quality-review\master-scenario-matrix-tier-1_v1
pmc\pmct\quality-review\master-scenario-matrix-tier-2_v1
pmc\pmct\quality-review\master-scenario-matrix-tier-3_v1

2. **Populate Tier 1 Template Assignments in file:** pmc\pmct\quality-review\master-scenario-matrix-tier-1_v1
   - Assign 10 conversations to Template A (Confusion→Clarity)
   - Assign 8 conversations to Template B (Shame→Acceptance)
   - Assign 8 conversations to Template C (Couple Conflict→Alignment)
   - Assign 8 conversations to Template D (Anxiety→Confidence)
   - Assign 6 conversations to Template E (Grief/Loss→Healing)
   - Vary persona age, income, and topics systematically
   - Ensure no duplicate combinations

3. **Define Tier 2 Scenarios in file:** pmc\pmct\quality-review\master-scenario-matrix-tier-2_v1 (35 specific scenarios)
   - Write 2-3 sentence scenario description for each
   - Identify required emotional arc
   - Note special considerations (cultural, legal, therapeutic)
   - Flag which expert reviewers needed

4. **Define Tier 3 Edge Cases in file:** pmc\pmct\quality-review\master-scenario-matrix-tier-3_v1 (15 specific cases)
   - Write scenario description emphasizing boundary
   - Identify proper referral resources
   - Note any legal/ethical consultation needed
   - Document crisis protocols if applicable

**Outputs:**
- ✅ 3 Master Scenario Matrix CSV files
- ✅ All conversations pre-assigned to tiers and types
- ✅ Systematic variation ensured
- ✅ Expert review needs documented

**Time Estimate:** 4 hours

## TROUBLESHOOTING GUIDE

### Issue: Generated conversation fails quality check
**Solution:** Refine prompt with specific gaps noted, regenerate (P2)

### Issue: Expert reviewer finds major financial error
**Solution:** Correct in JSON, flag pattern for future prompts, re-review

### Issue: Elena voice drift detected
**Solution:** Pause batch, review Phase 1 examples, recalibrate, update prompts

### Issue: Batch taking longer than 1 week
**Solution:** Identify bottleneck (generation vs review), adjust scheduling

### Issue: Quality scores dropping below 4.5 average
**Solution:** Stop production, analyze patterns, retrain on quality standards
