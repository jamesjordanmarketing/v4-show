# Vercel 404 Deployment Issue - Comprehensive Analysis
## lora-pipeline Project Build and Routing Failure

**Date:** November 7, 2025  
**Project:** lora-pipeline (Bright Run LoRA Training Data Platform)  
**Issue:** Deploys successfully but returns 404 on all routes  
**Status:** UNRESOLVED after 5 attempts

---

## Executive Summary

The lora-pipeline Next.js 14 application builds successfully on Vercel but returns 404 errors on all routes. Multiple configuration attempts have been made, alternating between:
1. Root Directory setting in Vercel dashboard
2. vercel.json file location (root vs src/)
3. Build command complexity (simple vs explicit navigation)
4. Package.json interference (workspaces, scripts)

**Key Observation:** Last deployment took only **7 seconds** (should take 60+ seconds), indicating Vercel is not actually building the Next.js application despite claiming success.

---

## Project Background & Context

### Product Overview
- **Name:** Bright Run LoRA Training Data Platform (lora-pipeline)
- **Purpose:** Transform unstructured business knowledge into LoRA fine-tuning training datasets
- **Tech Stack:** Next.js 14.2.33, React 18, TypeScript, Supabase, Tailwind CSS
- **Deployment Target:** Vercel
- **Reference Project:** chunks-alpha (working deployment with similar structure)

### Project Structure (Non-Standard)

```

**Critical Context:** The `src/` directory contains the entire Next.js application. The repository root contains build tools (`pmc/`), documentation (`docs/`), and utility scripts (`scripts/`) that should NOT be deployed to Vercel.

---

## Application Code Analysis

### Root Route Configuration

**File:** `C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\BRun\lora-pipeline\src\app\page.tsx`

```typescript
'use client'

import { useAuth } from '../lib/auth-context'
import { useRouter } from 'next/navigation'
import { useEffect } from 'react'

export default function HomePage() {
  const { user, isLoading } = useAuth()
  const router = useRouter()

  useEffect(() => {
    if (!isLoading) {
      if (user) {
        router.push('/dashboard')
      } else {
        router.push('/signin')
      }
    }
  }, [user, isLoading, router])

  if (isLoading) {
    return (
      <div className="min-h-screen flex items-center justify-center">
        <div className="text-center">
          <div className="animate-spin rounded-full h-32 w-32 border-b-2 border-gray-900"></div>
          <p className="mt-4 text-gray-600">Loading...</p>
        </div>
      </div>
    )
  }

  return null
}
```

**Analysis:**
- ✅ Client component (uses hooks)
- ✅ Depends on AuthProvider context
- ✅ Redirects authenticated users to `/dashboard`
- ✅ Redirects unauthenticated users to `/signin`
- ⚠️ Returns null when not loading (after redirect)
- ⚠️ Requires Supabase to be functional (auth checks)

**Potential Issues:**
1. **Client-side only rendering** - Page returns null after initial redirect, might confuse Vercel's static generation
2. **Supabase dependency** - If environment variables aren't set, auth context might fail, causing the page to not render properly
3. **No static fallback** - Purely client-side routing without server-side or static generation

### Next.js Configuration

**File:** `C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\BRun\lora-pipeline\src\next.config.js`

```javascript
async redirects() {
  return [
    {
      source: '/',
      destination: '/dashboard',
      permanent: false,
    },
  ]
},
```

**Analysis:**
- ✅ Server-side redirect from `/` to `/dashboard`
- ⚠️ **CONFLICTS** with client-side redirect in page.tsx
- ⚠️ Assumes `/dashboard` is always accessible (but it's auth-protected)

**Critical Issue Identified:** Double redirect logic:
1. Next.js config redirects `/` → `/dashboard` (server-side)
2. page.tsx tries to redirect based on auth state (client-side)

This might cause routing confusion or infinite redirects, especially if the build process can't resolve these during static generation.

### Root Layout

**File:** `C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\BRun\lora-pipeline\src\app\layout.tsx`

```typescript
export const metadata = {
  title: 'Document Categorization System',
  description: 'Categorize and tag documents efficiently',
}

export default function RootLayout({ children }: { children: React.ReactNode }) {
  return (
    <html lang="en">
      <body>
        <ErrorBoundary>
          <OnlineStatusProvider>
            <ReactQueryProvider>
              <AuthProvider redirectTo="/dashboard">
                {children}
              </AuthProvider>
            </ReactQueryProvider>
            <Toaster richColors position="top-right" />
          </OnlineStatusProvider>
        </ErrorBoundary>
      </body>
    </html>
  )
}
```

**Analysis:**
- ✅ Standard Next.js 14 App Router layout
- ✅ Multiple providers (auth, React Query, online status)
- ✅ Error boundary for graceful error handling
- ⚠️ Depends on `lib/auth-context` which requires Supabase
- ⚠️ No suspense boundaries for async operations

### Auth Context

**File:** `C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\BRun\lora-pipeline\src\lib\auth-context.tsx`

- Uses Supabase for authentication
- Checks session on mount with 10-second timeout
- Requires environment variables:
  - `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`
  - `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`
  - `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` (optional, falls back to anon key)

**Potential Issue:** If environment variables aren't set in Vercel, the auth context might fail during server-side rendering or static generation, preventing pages from building correctly.

## Deployment History - 5 Attempts

### Attempt #1: Original Configuration (FAILED - 404)

**Configuration:**
- **vercel.json location:** Repository root (`C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\BRun\lora-pipeline\vercel.json`)
- **Vercel Root Directory:** `src`
- **Commands:**
  ```json
  {
    "buildCommand": "cd src && npm run build",
    "outputDirectory": "src/.next",
    "installCommand": "npm install --prefix src",
    "framework": null
  }
  ```
- **Root package.json:** Had `workspaces: ["src"]` and proxy scripts

**Result:** 
- Build succeeded (60+ seconds)
- Deployment succeeded
- ❌ All routes returned 404

**Analysis:** The combination of Root Directory = `src` with vercel.json in repository root containing "cd src" commands created path confusion. Vercel was already in the `src/` directory but commands tried to navigate there again.

---

### Attempt #2: Moved vercel.json to src/ (FAILED - Build error)

**Configuration:**
- **vercel.json location:** `C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\BRun\lora-pipeline\src\vercel.json`
- **Vercel Root Directory:** `src`
- **Commands:**
  ```json
  {
    "framework": "nextjs",
    "buildCommand": "npm run build",
    "outputDirectory": ".next",
    "installCommand": "npm install"
  }
  ```
- **Root package.json:** Still had `workspaces: ["src"]`

**Result:**
- ❌ Build failed: "No Output Directory named 'public' found"
- Build completed but couldn't find output

**Analysis:** Despite explicit `outputDirectory: ".next"`, Vercel looked for "public" directory. The root package.json with `workspaces` field made Vercel treat this as a monorepo, building from root instead of src/ despite the Root Directory setting.

---

### Attempt #3: Removed workspaces from root package.json (FAILED - 7 sec deploy)

**Configuration:**
- **vercel.json location:** `C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\BRun\lora-pipeline\src\vercel.json`
- **Vercel Root Directory:** `src`
- **Commands:** Same as Attempt #2
- **Root package.json:** 
  ```json
  {
    "name": "lora-pipeline-root",
    "version": "1.0.0",
    "private": true,
    "description": "Bright Run LoRA Training Data Platform - Root workspace. Vercel builds from src/ directory."
  }
  ```
  (Removed all scripts and workspaces field)

**Result:**
- ✅ "Build" completed in **7 seconds**
- ✅ Deployment succeeded
- ❌ All routes returned 404

**Critical Discovery:** **7-second deployment = NO BUILD ACTUALLY HAPPENED**

A real Next.js build takes 60+ seconds. The 7-second deployment means Vercel deployed something minimal (maybe just static files) but didn't actually build the Next.js application.

**Analysis:** With Root Directory = `src` and vercel.json in `src/`, Vercel couldn't properly execute the build process. It "succeeded" but didn't actually compile the Next.js app.

---

### Attempt #4: Moved vercel.json back to root, cleared Root Directory (FAILED - Function path error)

**Configuration:**
- **vercel.json location:** Repository root (`C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\BRun\lora-pipeline\vercel.json`)
- **Vercel Root Directory:** Blank (`.` or empty)
- **Commands:**
  ```json
  {
    "buildCommand": "cd src && npm install && npm run build",
    "outputDirectory": "src/.next",
    "installCommand": "npm install --prefix ./src",
    "functions": {
      "src/app/api/cron/daily-maintenance/route.ts": { "maxDuration": 300 },
      ...
    }
  }
  ```

**Result:**
- ❌ Build failed in 4 seconds
- Error: "The pattern 'src/app/api/cron/daily-maintenance/route.ts' defined in `functions` doesn't match any Serverless Functions inside the `api` directory."

**Analysis:** With Next.js 14 App Router, function paths in vercel.json don't work the same way. The `functions` configuration is for legacy API routes (`pages/api/`), not App Router routes (`app/api/`).

---

### Attempt #5: Removed functions config, back to src/ location (FAILED - 7 sec deploy + 404)

**Configuration:**
- **vercel.json location:** `C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\BRun\lora-pipeline\src\vercel.json`
- **Vercel Root Directory:** `src`
- **Commands:**
  ```json
  {
    "framework": "nextjs",
    "buildCommand": "npm run build",
    "installCommand": "npm install",
    "crons": [
      { "path": "/api/cron/daily-maintenance", "schedule": "0 2 * * *" },
      { "path": "/api/cron/export-file-cleanup", "schedule": "0 2 * * *" }
    ]
  }
  ```
- **Root package.json:** Minimal (no scripts/workspaces)

**Result:**
- ✅ "Build" completed in **7 seconds**
- ✅ Deployment succeeded
- ❌ All routes returned 404

**Analysis:** Same issue as Attempt #3. The 7-second deployment proves Vercel is NOT building the Next.js application properly.

## Vercel Dashboard Settings Comparison

### lora-pipeline (NOT WORKING)

**Framework Settings:**
- **Framework Preset:** Next.js
- **Build Command:** `npm run build` (Override enabled)
- **Output Directory:** `Next.js default` (Override enabled)
- **Install Command:** `npm install` (Override enabled)
- **Development Command:** next (no override shown)

**Root Directory:**
- **Setting:** `src` (Enabled)
- **Include files outside the Root Directory:** Enabled (Build Step ✓)
- **Skip deployments when changes are not in Root Directory:** Disabled

**Node.js Version:** 22.x

**Build Machine:** Standard performance (4 vCPUs, 8 GB Memory)

---

### chunks-alpha (WORKING)

**Framework Settings:**
- **Framework Preset:** Next.js
- **Build Command:** `npm run build` (no override indicators visible)
- **Output Directory:** `Next.js default` (no override indicators visible)
- **Install Command:** `npm install` (no override indicators visible)
- **Development Command:** next

**Root Directory:**
- **Setting:** `src` (Enabled)
- **Include files outside the Root Directory:** Enabled (Build Step ✓)
- **Skip deployments when changes are not in Root Directory:** Disabled

**Node.js Version:** 22.x

**Build Machine:** Standard performance (4 vCPUs, 8 GB Memory)

**Key Difference Observed:** 
chunks-alpha shows build/install commands without explicit "Override" badges, while lora-pipeline shows "Override" enabled for all commands. This suggests Vercel might be handling them differently.

---

## Comparison with chunks-alpha (Working Reference)

### Similarities
✅ Same directory structure (`src/` as app root)  
✅ Same Next.js version (14.2.33)  
✅ Same React version (18)  
✅ Same Vercel Root Directory setting (`src`)  
✅ Same basic dependencies (Supabase, Radix UI, Tailwind)  
✅ Both use Next.js 14 App Router  
✅ Both have vercel.json in `src/` directory

### Differences

| Aspect | lora-pipeline | chunks-alpha |
|--------|-----------|--------------|
| **Root page.tsx** | Client component with auth redirect | Client component with auth redirect (same pattern) |
| **next.config.js redirects** | Has `/` → `/dashboard` redirect | Has `/` → `/dashboard` redirect (same) |
| **vercel.json functions** | Removed (causes errors) | Has 3 function timeout configs |
| **Root package.json** | Minimal (no scripts) | Unknown (not checked) |
| **Vercel "Override" badges** | Shows "Override" for build/install commands | No "Override" indicators visible |
| **Dependencies** | Has additional: React Query, csv-stringify, zod | Simpler dependency list |
| **Build success rate** | Deploys in 7 seconds (not building) | Builds properly (60+ seconds) |

**Critical Unknown:** We haven't examined chunks-alpha's root package.json to see if it has scripts or workspace configuration.

### Vercel Dashboard Settings

- **Root Directory:** `src` ✅
- **Framework:** Next.js ✅  
- **Build Command:** `npm run build` (Override)
- **Install Command:** `npm install` (Override)
- **Include files outside Root Directory:** Enabled ✅

### Current vercel.json Content

**Location:** `C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\BRun\lora-pipeline\src\vercel.json`

```json
{
  "framework": "nextjs",
  "buildCommand": "npm run build",
  "installCommand": "npm install",
  "crons": [
    {
      "path": "/api/cron/daily-maintenance",
      "schedule": "0 2 * * *"
    },
    {
      "path": "/api/cron/export-file-cleanup",
      "schedule": "0 2 * * *"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Symptoms

1. ✅ Deployment completes "successfully"
2. ❌ Takes only **7 seconds** (should be 60+)
3. ❌ All routes return 404
4. ❌ No errors in deployment logs
5. ❌ Vercel acts as if no Next.js app exists

---

## Root Cause Theories

### Theory #1: Vercel Build Detection Failure (MOST LIKELY)

**Hypothesis:** With Root Directory = `src` and vercel.json in `src/`, Vercel's build system gets confused about:
- Where the Next.js app actually is
- Where to execute commands
- Where to look for package.json
- Where build output should be

**Evidence:**
- 7-second deployments (no actual build)
- No build logs showing Next.js compilation
- 404s on all routes (no router generated)

**Why chunks-alpha works:** Unknown difference in configuration or Vercel project history that makes it detect the build correctly.

---

### Theory #2: Next.js Configuration Conflict

**Hypothesis:** The combination of:
1. Server-side redirect in next.config.js (`/` → `/dashboard`)
2. Client-side redirect in page.tsx (auth-based)
3. Auth dependencies requiring environment variables
4. Client-only rendering on root route

...causes Next.js to fail during static generation or build time, but Vercel doesn't report it as an error.

**Evidence:**
- Root page returns `null` after redirect
- No static HTML generated for `/`
- Potential infinite redirect loop
- Auth context might fail without proper env vars

---

### Theory #3: Vercel Project Configuration Corruption

**Hypothesis:** The Vercel project configuration has become corrupted or confused after multiple configuration changes. The "Override" badges in settings suggest manual overrides that might be conflicting.

**Evidence:**
- chunks-alpha shows no "Override" indicators
- lora-pipeline shows "Override" for multiple settings
- Different behavior despite similar vercel.json files

---

### Theory #4: Build Output Directory Mismatch

**Hypothesis:** Vercel is building to the wrong location or can't find the build output:
- Building in repository root instead of src/
- Looking for output in wrong location
- Output exists but Vercel's router can't find it

**Evidence:**
- "No public directory found" errors in earlier attempts
- 7-second deployments suggest minimal file copying
- 404s suggest no routing configuration loaded

---

## Proposed Solutions

### Solution #1: Match chunks-alpha Exactly + Fresh Vercel Project (RECOMMENDED)

**Rationale:** Start fresh with exact working configuration, eliminate Vercel project corruption

**Steps:**

1. **Research chunks-alpha configuration fully**
   - Check `C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\BRun\v4-show\package.json` (root)
   - Check if chunks-alpha has any hidden Vercel configuration
   - Check chunks-alpha Vercel project settings export/JSON
   - Compare environment variables in both projects

2. **Create NEW Vercel project for lora-pipeline**
   - Don't try to fix existing project
   - Start fresh to avoid configuration corruption
   - Import from same GitHub repo but new Vercel project

3. **Configure exactly like chunks-alpha**
   - Match Root Directory setting exactly
   - Match vercel.json location and content exactly
   - Match root package.json exactly
   - Set same environment variables

4. **Deploy and compare**
   - If it works: Old Vercel project was corrupted
   - If it fails: There's a difference in application code

**Files to create/modify:**
- `C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\BRun\lora-pipeline\package.json` (match chunks-alpha)
- `C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\BRun\lora-pipeline\src\vercel.json` (match chunks-alpha)
- New Vercel project settings

**Risk:** Low - We're replicating a known-working configuration  
**Effort:** Medium - Requires research and Vercel project setup  
**Success Probability:** 70% - If Vercel project corruption is the issue

---

### Solution #2: Fix Root Route Rendering Issues

**Rationale:** The root route's client-only rendering with null return might be breaking Vercel's static generation

**Steps:**

1. **Remove server-side redirect from next.config.js**
   ```javascript
   // Remove this from next.config.js:
   async redirects() {
     return [
       {
         source: '/',
         destination: '/dashboard',
         permanent: false,
       },
     ]
   },
   ```

2. **Create proper static root page**
   
   **File:** `C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\BRun\lora-pipeline\src\app\page.tsx`
   
   ```typescript
   import { redirect } from 'next/navigation'
   import { createServerComponentClient } from '@supabase/auth-helpers-nextjs'
   import { cookies } from 'next/headers'
   
   export default async function HomePage() {
     const supabase = createServerComponentClient({ cookies })
     const { data: { session } } = await supabase.auth.getSession()
     
     if (session) {
       redirect('/dashboard')
     } else {
       redirect('/signin')
     }
   }
   ```

3. **Add generateStaticParams or force dynamic**
   
   ```typescript
   // Add this to page.tsx
   export const dynamic = 'force-dynamic'
   ```

4. **Test locally first**
   ```bash
   cd C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\BRun\lora-pipeline\src
   npm run build
   npm run start
   ```

**Files to modify:**
- `C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\BRun\lora-pipeline\src\app\page.tsx`
- `C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\BRun\lora-pipeline\src\next.config.js`

**Risk:** Medium - Changes routing behavior  
**Effort:** Low - Simple code changes  
**Success Probability:** 40% - Might fix static generation issues

---

### Solution #3: Explicit Build Configuration in Root

**Rationale:** Force Vercel to build from a known configuration in repository root

**Steps:**

1. **Move vercel.json to repository root**
   ```bash
   mv C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\BRun\lora-pipeline\src\vercel.json C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\BRun\lora-pipeline\vercel.json
   ```

2. **Clear Root Directory in Vercel dashboard**
   - Set Root Directory to blank/`.`
   - Save settings

3. **Update vercel.json with explicit paths**
   
   **File:** `C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\BRun\lora-pipeline\vercel.json`
   
   ```json
   {
     "github": {
       "silent": true
     },
     "buildCommand": "cd src && npm ci && npm run build",
     "outputDirectory": "src/.next",
     "installCommand": "npm ci --prefix src",
     "devCommand": "cd src && npm run dev",
     "framework": null,
     "crons": [
       {
         "path": "/api/cron/daily-maintenance",
         "schedule": "0 2 * * *"
       },
       {
         "path": "/api/cron/export-file-cleanup",
         "schedule": "0 2 * * *"
       }
     ]
   }
   ```

4. **Add build script to root package.json**
   
   **File:** `C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\BRun\lora-pipeline\package.json`
   
   ```json
   {
     "name": "lora-pipeline-root",
     "version": "1.0.0",
     "private": true,
     "scripts": {
       "vercel-build": "cd src && npm ci && npm run build"
     },
     "description": "Bright Run LoRA Training Data Platform"
   }
   ```

5. **Test deployment**

**Files to create/modify:**
- `C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\BRun\lora-pipeline\vercel.json` (move from src/)
- `C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\BRun\lora-pipeline\package.json` (add build script)

**Risk:** Low - Similar to Attempt #4 but refined  
**Effort:** Low - File moves and simple edits  
**Success Probability:** 50% - Forces clear build path

---

### Solution #4: Debug with Vercel Build Logs & CLI

**Rationale:** Get detailed information about what Vercel is actually doing during the 7-second "build"

**Steps:**

1. **Install Vercel CLI locally**
   ```bash
   npm install -g vercel
   ```

2. **Link local project to Vercel**
   ```bash
   cd C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\BRun\lora-pipeline
   vercel link
   ```

3. **Run local Vercel build**
   ```bash
   vercel build --debug
   ```

4. **Examine build output**
   - Check what files are being included
   - Check what commands are actually executing
   - Check for any hidden errors or warnings

5. **Compare with chunks-alpha**
   ```bash
   cd C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\BRun\chunks-alpha
   vercel build --debug
   ```

6. **Look for differences in**:
   - File detection
   - Framework detection
   - Build command execution
   - Output directory handling

7. **Enable verbose logging in Vercel dashboard**
   - Project Settings → General → Logs
   - Enable all logging options
   - Deploy again and examine full logs

**Files needed:**
- None (diagnostic only)

**Risk:** None - Diagnostic only  
**Effort:** Medium - Requires CLI setup and log analysis  
**Success Probability:** 90% for diagnosis - Will reveal what's happening

## Environment Variables Check

**Required for application to function:**

NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://[project].supabase.co
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=[anon_key]
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=[service_role_key]
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=[api_key]
```

**To verify in Vercel:**
1. Go to Project Settings → Environment Variables
2. Confirm all 4 variables are set
3. Check they're enabled for Production environment
4. Redeploy after setting if missing

**Note:** Missing environment variables might cause build-time failures that Vercel doesn't report properly, especially if components try to access them during server-side rendering.

## Recommended Next Steps (Priority Order)

### Immediate Actions (Do These First)

1. **Verify Environment Variables**
   - Check Vercel dashboard for all required env vars
   - Compare with chunks-alpha env vars
   - Deploy after confirming

2. **Check chunks-alpha Root package.json**
   - `C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\BRun\v4-show\package.json`
   - See if it has scripts or workspaces
   - Match lora-pipeline to it exactly

3. **Run Vercel CLI Debug Build (Solution #4)**
   - Install Vercel CLI
   - Run `vercel build --debug`
   - Compare output with chunks-alpha
   - This will reveal what's actually happening

### Secondary Actions (If Above Don't Work)

4. **Fix Root Route Rendering (Solution #2)**
   - Remove double redirect logic
   - Make root page server-component with proper redirect
   - Test locally before deploying

5. **Create Fresh Vercel Project (Solution #1)**
   - New Vercel project from scratch
   - Match chunks-alpha configuration exactly
   - Deploy and compare

### Alternative Actions (If All Else Fails)

6. **Explicit Root Build Configuration (Solution #3)**
   - Move vercel.json to root
   - Clear Root Directory setting
   - Use explicit "cd src" commands

7. **Contact Vercel Support**
   - Provide comparison with chunks-alpha
   - Share project IDs for both
   - Ask them to compare configurations
   - They might see internal settings we can't

## Key Questions Needing Answers

1. **What does chunks-alpha's root package.json contain?**
   - Does it have scripts?
   - Does it have workspaces field?
   - How does it differ from lora-pipeline's?

2. **What are the full Vercel build logs for a successful chunks-alpha deployment?**
   - How long does it take?
   - What commands are executed?
   - What does Vercel detect?

3. **What happens when running `vercel build --debug` locally?**
   - For lora-pipeline
   - For chunks-alpha
   - What are the differences?

4. **Are there any hidden Vercel configuration files?**
   - `.vercel/project.json`
   - `.vercel/README.txt`
   - Any project-specific settings

5. **What are the environment variables in both projects?**
   - Are they identical?
   - Are any missing in lora-pipeline?
   - Do they affect build process?

6. **Is there a Vercel project history that might show when chunks-alpha started working?**
   - What configuration change made it work?
   - Was it always working or fixed at some point?

## Success Criteria

A successful resolution will:

1. ✅ Build takes 60+ seconds (actual Next.js compilation)
2. ✅ Deployment logs show:
   - "Creating an optimized production build..."
   - "Linting and checking validity of types..."
   - "Generating static pages..."
   - "Build completed successfully"
3. ✅ Homepage (/) loads without 404
4. ✅ Redirects work properly (/ → /dashboard or /signin)
5. ✅ Dashboard route (/dashboard) loads
6. ✅ API routes respond (not 404)
7. ✅ Static assets load (CSS, JS, images)

---

## Conclusion

After 5 attempts and multiple configuration approaches, the lora-pipeline application fails to deploy properly to Vercel despite having nearly identical configuration to the working chunks-alpha project. The 7-second deployments prove Vercel is not actually building the Next.js application.

**Most Likely Causes:**
1. Vercel project configuration corruption from multiple changes
2. Hidden difference between chunks-alpha and lora-pipeline configurations
3. Root route rendering issues preventing static generation
4. Build detection failure due to Root Directory + vercel.json location confusion

**Recommended Approach:**
1. Run diagnostic build with Vercel CLI (Solution #4) to see actual behavior
2. Check chunks-alpha root package.json for differences
3. Create fresh Vercel project with exact chunks-alpha configuration (Solution #1)
4. If still failing, fix root route rendering (Solution #2)

**Next Agent Context:**
Review this analysis, run Solution #4 first (Vercel CLI debug), then proceed with Solution #1 (fresh Vercel project) if needed. Compare every detail between working chunks-alpha and failing lora-pipeline to find the difference.
