# Vercel 7-Second Deployment = Nothing Built - Critical Fix

**Date:** November 7, 2025  
**Issue:** Deployment completed in 7 seconds (should take 1+ minutes) = NO BUILD HAPPENED
**Status:** ⚠️ CRITICAL - Different approach needed

---

## What Happened

After Fix 3, deployment completed in only **7 seconds** (previous deploys took 60+ seconds). This means:

❌ **Vercel did NOT build the Next.js application**  
❌ **Vercel deployed basically nothing**  
❌ **Result: 404 on all routes**

---

## Why This Happened

The combination of:
- Root Directory = `src` (in Vercel dashboard)
- vercel.json in `src/` directory
- Minimal root package.json

...caused Vercel to not find or execute the build process at all.

---

## New Approach - Fix 4

### Move vercel.json BACK to Repository Root

```json
{
  "buildCommand": "cd src && npm install && npm run build",
  "outputDirectory": "src/.next",
  "installCommand": "npm install --prefix ./src",
  "functions": {
    "src/app/api/...": { "maxDuration": 300 }
  }
}
```

**Key differences:**
- File location: Repository ROOT (not src/)
- Commands: Explicitly navigate to `src/`
- Output: `src/.next` (relative to repo root)
- Functions: Paths prefixed with `src/`

### CRITICAL: Change Vercel Dashboard Settings

**Go to Vercel Dashboard → Project Settings → General:**

1. **Root Directory:** Leave BLANK or set to `.` (NOT `src`)
2. **Framework Preset:** Should auto-detect as "Other" or "Next.js"
3. **Build Command:** (leave blank, vercel.json will handle it)
4. **Output Directory:** (leave blank, vercel.json specifies it)
5. **Install Command:** (leave blank, vercel.json handles it)

**This is the critical change - REMOVE the `src` Root Directory setting!**

---

## Why This Will Work

With vercel.json in root and NO Root Directory setting:

1. ✅ Vercel starts in repository root
2. ✅ Finds vercel.json immediately
3. ✅ Executes: `cd src && npm install && npm run build`
4. ✅ Build runs (will take 60+ seconds)
5. ✅ Output goes to `src/.next`
6. ✅ Vercel finds output at `src/.next` (per outputDirectory)
7. ✅ Deployment works with all routes

---

## Deploy Instructions

### Step 1: Update Vercel Dashboard FIRST

1. Go to https://vercel.com/dashboard
2. Select your `lora-pipeline` project
3. Go to Settings → General
4. Find "Root Directory"
5. **CLEAR IT** (delete "src", leave blank or set to ".")
6. Click "Save"

### Step 2: Deploy Code Changes

```bash
cd C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\BRun\lora-pipeline

# Remove src/vercel.json (already done by tool)
# Add root vercel.json (already done by tool)

git add -A
git commit -m "fix: Move vercel.json to root and remove Root Directory setting

Vercel wasn't building when Root Directory=src with vercel.json in src/.
Moving vercel.json to root with explicit 'cd src' commands.
Must also CLEAR Root Directory setting in Vercel dashboard."

git push origin main
```

### Step 3: Verify Build

Watch the deployment logs. You should see:
- ✅ Build takes 60+ seconds (NOT 7 seconds!)
- ✅ "Compiling..." messages
- ✅ "Generating static pages..." messages  
- ✅ "Build completed successfully"

If it deploys in < 10 seconds, the Root Directory setting is still set!

## Why chunks-alpha Works

Looking back at your note: *"chunks-alpha DOES have src configured as the root directory"*

But chunks-alpha might have:
- vercel.json in a different location
- Different build configuration
- Or Vercel is treating it differently for some reason

**For lora-pipeline, we need to use the root approach.**

---

## Comparison

### What We Just Tried (FAILED - 7 sec deploy)
```
Root Directory: src
vercel.json location: src/
Commands: npm run build (relative to src/)
Result: Nothing built, 7 second deploy, 404s
```

### What We're Doing Now (SHOULD WORK)
```
Root Directory: . (blank/root)
vercel.json location: root/
Commands: cd src && npm run build
outputDirectory: src/.next
Result: Should build properly, 60+ second deploy, routes work
```

---

## Critical Checklist

Before pushing code:

- [ ] Vercel Dashboard → Settings → General → Root Directory = **BLANK or `.`** (NOT `src`)
- [ ] vercel.json is in **repository root** (not src/)
- [ ] vercel.json has `"buildCommand": "cd src && ..."`
- [ ] vercel.json has `"outputDirectory": "src/.next"`

After pushing:

- [ ] Build takes 60+ seconds (not 7 seconds!)
- [ ] Build logs show Next.js compilation
- [ ] Deployment succeeds
- [ ] Homepage loads (no 404)

---

## If This Still Doesn't Work

Then we need to see:
1. Exact Vercel dashboard settings screenshot
2. Full deployment logs
3. Vercel project configuration JSON (if accessible)

There might be a setting or configuration we're missing that chunks-alpha has.

---

**The 7-second deployment was the smoking gun. Vercel wasn't building anything. This approach forces a proper build from root.**
