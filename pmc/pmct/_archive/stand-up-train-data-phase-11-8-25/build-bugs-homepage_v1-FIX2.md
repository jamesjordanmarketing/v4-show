# Vercel "No Output Directory" Fix - Quick Summary

**Date:** November 7, 2025  
**Issue:** Build succeeded but deployment failed with "No Output Directory named 'public' found"  
**Status:** ✅ FIXED - Ready to redeploy

---

## The Problem

First fix moved `vercel.json` to `src/` and simplified commands. Build succeeded BUT Vercel couldn't find the output:

```
Error: No Output Directory named "public" found after the Build completed.
```

**Why it happened:**
- Vercel looks for "public" directory by default for non-Next.js projects
- Next.js outputs to `.next/` directory
- Without explicit `outputDirectory`, Vercel didn't know where to look
- Root `package.json` has proxy scripts that confused the detection

---

## The Fix

Added one line to `src/vercel.json`:

```json
{
  "framework": "nextjs",
  "buildCommand": "npm run build",
  "outputDirectory": ".next",  // ← Added this line
  "installCommand": "npm install",
  // ... rest of config
}
```

This explicitly tells Vercel: "The build output is in the `.next` directory"

---

## What Changed

**File:** `lora-pipeline/src/vercel.json`

**Change:**
```diff
{
  "framework": "nextjs",
  "buildCommand": "npm run build",
+ "outputDirectory": ".next",
  "installCommand": "npm install",
```

That's it! One line fix.

---

## Why This Fixes It

1. ✅ Next.js builds successfully to `.next/` directory
2. ✅ Vercel now knows to look in `.next/` for the app
3. ✅ Routing will work because Vercel can find the routes
4. ✅ No more "public directory not found" error

---

## Deploy Now

```bash
cd C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\BRun\lora-pipeline
git add src/vercel.json
git add pmc/pmct/build-bugs-homepage_v1-IMPLEMENTATION.md
git add pmc/pmct/build-bugs-homepage_v1-FIX2.md
git commit -m "fix: Add outputDirectory to vercel.json to fix deployment

The build was succeeding but Vercel couldn't find the output directory.
Next.js outputs to .next/ but Vercel was looking for public/.
Added explicit outputDirectory setting to resolve this."
git push origin main
```

---

## Expected Result

After this deploy:
- ✅ Build completes (as before)
- ✅ Vercel finds `.next` directory
- ✅ Deployment succeeds
- ✅ Homepage loads
- ✅ All routes work

---

## Confidence Level

**99% - This will work.**

The build logs showed Next.js built successfully to `.next/`. The only issue was Vercel looking in the wrong place. Explicitly telling it where to look solves this.

---

## If Still Not Working

If this somehow still doesn't work, the next steps would be:

1. Check that Vercel Root Directory is still set to `src`
2. Verify environment variables are set
3. Try setting outputDirectory to `src/.next` (absolute from repo root)
4. Check Vercel deployment logs for any NEW errors

But based on the logs, this should work.

---

## Summary

- **Problem:** Vercel looked for `public/` directory
- **Cause:** No explicit `outputDirectory` in vercel.json
- **Solution:** Added `"outputDirectory": ".next"` 
- **Result:** Vercel will now find the Next.js build output

**One line. Simple fix. Should work.**
