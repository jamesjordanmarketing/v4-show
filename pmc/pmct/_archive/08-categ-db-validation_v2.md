···············································································································
**VALIDATION PROMPT START**
···············································································································

## Context

You are validating the completed implementation of Prompts 1, 2, and 3 for the normalized database structure. The system should now write ALL workflow form inputs to normalized Supabase tables (`document_categories`, `document_tags`, `custom_tags`) and display that data from the database on the webpage.

## Your Role

Act as a QA testing agent. Execute the test scenarios below and **document all findings** in the test results file.

## Test Results Documentation

**IMPORTANT:** As you complete each test, document your findings in this file:

**File Path:** `pmc\pmct\08-categ-db-validation-test-results_v1.md`

- Create this file at the start of testing
- Update it after completing each test scenario
- Include all evidence (SQL results, screenshots, observations)
- Use the Test Result Report Format provided at the end of this prompt
- Keep this file updated throughout the testing process

## Prerequisites Verification

Before testing, verify these are in place:

1. ✅ Environment variable `NEXT_PUBLIC_USE_NORMALIZED_TAGS=true` is set
2. ✅ Database tables exist: `document_categories`, `document_tags`, `custom_tags`
3. ✅ Application compiles without TypeScript errors
4. ✅ Development server is running

## Test Scenarios

### Test 1: Complete Workflow Submission (Write to Normalized Tables)

**Objective:** Verify all form inputs are written to normalized database tables

**Steps:**
1. Navigate to workflow start page
2. Select a document for categorization
3. **Step A:** Select a belonging rating (1-5)
4. **Step B:** Select a primary category
5. **Step C:** Select tags from at least 3 dimensions including:
   - Authorship (required)
   - Disclosure-risk (required)
   - Intended-use (required)
   - Plus 2-3 optional dimensions
6. Click "Submit for Processing"

**Validation Points:**

Open Supabase SQL Editor and run these queries:

```sql
-- Get the most recent workflow submission
SELECT 
    ws.id as workflow_id,
    ws.document_id,
    ws.step,
    ws.is_draft,
    ws.completed_at,
    d.title as document_title
FROM workflow_sessions ws
LEFT JOIN documents d ON d.id = ws.document_id
ORDER BY ws.created_at DESC
LIMIT 1;
```

**Expected Result:** 
- `step` = 'complete'
- `is_draft` = false
- `completed_at` is populated

```sql
-- Check document_categories table
SELECT 
    dc.id,
    dc.belonging_rating,
    c.name as category_name,
    dc.is_primary
FROM document_categories dc
LEFT JOIN categories c ON c.id = dc.category_id
WHERE dc.workflow_session_id = 'YOUR_WORKFLOW_ID_FROM_ABOVE'
ORDER BY dc.assigned_at DESC;
```

**Expected Result:**
- One row exists
- `belonging_rating` matches what you selected (1-5)
- `category_name` matches selected category
- `is_primary` = true

```sql
-- Check document_tags table
SELECT 
    dt.id,
    t.name as tag_name,
    td.name as dimension_name,
    dt.is_custom_tag
FROM document_tags dt
LEFT JOIN tags t ON t.id = dt.tag_id
LEFT JOIN tag_dimensions td ON td.id = dt.dimension_id
WHERE dt.workflow_session_id = 'YOUR_WORKFLOW_ID_FROM_ABOVE'
ORDER BY td.sort_order, t.name;
```

**Expected Result:**
- Number of rows matches number of tags you selected
- All dimension names appear (authorship, disclosure-risk, intended-use, etc.)
- All tag names match your selections
- `is_custom_tag` = false for standard tags

**✅ Pass Criteria:**
- [ ] All form inputs appear in normalized tables
- [ ] Belonging rating is correct
- [ ] Category is correct
- [ ] All tags are recorded
- [ ] Foreign key relationships are intact
- [ ] Timestamps are populated

**❌ Fail Indicators:**
- Missing data in any table
- Null foreign keys
- Wrong values stored
- Database constraint violations

---

### Test 2: Display Data from Normalized Tables (Read & Display)

**Objective:** Verify the completion page displays data fetched from normalized database tables

**Steps:**
1. After completing Test 1, observe the URL in the browser
2. Note the URL should include `?workflowId={some-uuid}`
3. Verify the completion page displays:
   - Document title
   - Belonging rating (e.g., "4/5 - Strong relationship")
   - Primary category name
   - All selected tags grouped by dimension
   - Tag counts per dimension

**Validation Points:**

Compare displayed data against database:

```sql
-- Get complete workflow data for display verification
SELECT 
    -- Category data
    c.name as displayed_category,
    dc.belonging_rating as displayed_rating,
    -- Tags data
    (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM document_tags WHERE workflow_session_id = 'YOUR_WORKFLOW_ID') as total_tags,
    (SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT dimension_id) FROM document_tags WHERE workflow_session_id = 'YOUR_WORKFLOW_ID') as dimension_count
FROM workflow_sessions ws
LEFT JOIN document_categories dc ON dc.workflow_session_id = ws.id
LEFT JOIN categories c ON c.id = dc.category_id
WHERE ws.id = 'YOUR_WORKFLOW_ID';
```

**Expected Result:**
- Category name on page matches `displayed_category` from query
- Rating on page matches `displayed_rating` from query
- Tag count on page matches `total_tags` from query
- Dimension count matches `dimension_count` from query

**✅ Pass Criteria:**
- [ ] Category displayed correctly
- [ ] Belonging rating displayed correctly
- [ ] All tags display in correct dimensions
- [ ] Tag counts are accurate
- [ ] No "undefined" or null values shown
- [ ] Data is from database, not in-memory store

**❌ Fail Indicators:**
- Display shows different data than database
- Missing tags or categories
- Showing mock data instead of real data
- "Loading..." stuck or errors

---

### Test 3: Page Refresh Persistence

**Objective:** Verify data persists after page refresh (proving it's from database, not memory)

**Steps:**
1. From Test 2, note all displayed data (category, rating, tags)
2. Press F5 or Ctrl+R to refresh the page
3. Wait for page to reload completely
4. Compare displayed data after refresh

**✅ Pass Criteria:**
- [ ] All data remains identical after refresh
- [ ] No loss of information
- [ ] Page loads successfully
- [ ] Same workflow ID in URL
- [ ] No errors in browser console

**❌ Fail Indicators:**
- Data disappears after refresh
- Page shows different/mock data
- Console errors appear
- Redirect to different page

---

### Test 4: Feature Flag Toggle

**Objective:** Verify backward compatibility with JSONB storage

**Steps:**
1. Set `NEXT_PUBLIC_USE_NORMALIZED_TAGS=false` in `.env.local`
2. Restart development server
3. Complete a new workflow (Steps A → B → C)
4. Submit workflow

**Validation Points:**

Check that data is written to JSONB fields:

```sql
-- Check JSONB storage (legacy mode)
SELECT 
    id,
    step,
    is_draft,
    selected_category_id,
    selected_tags,  -- Should be populated (JSONB)
    custom_tags,    -- Should be populated (JSONB)
    belonging_rating
FROM workflow_sessions
ORDER BY created_at DESC
LIMIT 1;
```

**Expected Result:**
- `selected_tags` is populated with JSONB data
- `custom_tags` is populated (if custom tags used)
- Data is NOT in `document_categories` or `document_tags` tables

**Then:**
5. Set `NEXT_PUBLIC_USE_NORMALIZED_TAGS=true` again
6. Restart development server
7. Complete another workflow
8. Verify data goes to normalized tables (repeat Test 1 queries)

**✅ Pass Criteria:**
- [ ] Legacy mode writes to JSONB fields
- [ ] Normalized mode writes to junction tables
- [ ] Feature flag controls behavior correctly
- [ ] No errors in either mode
- [ ] System works in both modes

**❌ Fail Indicators:**
- Feature flag has no effect
- Errors when toggling modes
- Data written to wrong location
- Partial writes (some JSONB, some normalized)

---

### Test 5: Custom Tags Creation

**Objective:** Verify custom tags are created as first-class entities

**Steps:**
1. Complete workflow Steps A → B
2. In Step C, create a custom tag:
   - Select a dimension (e.g., "Evidence Type")
   - Click "Add Custom Tag"
   - Enter name: "Test Custom Tag XYZ"
   - Enter description: "Testing custom tag functionality"
   - Save and add to selection
3. Complete workflow and submit

**Validation Points:**

```sql
-- Check custom_tags table
SELECT 
    ct.id,
    ct.name,
    ct.description,
    td.name as dimension,
    ct.usage_count,
    ct.created_at
FROM custom_tags ct
LEFT JOIN tag_dimensions td ON td.id = ct.dimension_id
WHERE ct.name = 'Test Custom Tag XYZ'
ORDER BY ct.created_at DESC
LIMIT 1;
```

**Expected Result:**
- Custom tag exists in `custom_tags` table
- Name and description match what you entered
- `usage_count` = 1 (or incremented if reused)
- Dimension is correct

```sql
-- Check custom tag assignment
SELECT 
    dt.id,
    dt.is_custom_tag,
    ct.name as custom_tag_name
FROM document_tags dt
LEFT JOIN custom_tags ct ON ct.id = dt.tag_id
WHERE dt.is_custom_tag = true
AND dt.workflow_session_id = 'YOUR_WORKFLOW_ID'
ORDER BY dt.assigned_at DESC;
```

**Expected Result:**
- Row exists in `document_tags`
- `is_custom_tag` = true
- Custom tag name appears

**✅ Pass Criteria:**
- [ ] Custom tag created in `custom_tags` table
- [ ] Custom tag linked in `document_tags` table
- [ ] `is_custom_tag` flag is true
- [ ] Custom tag displays on completion page
- [ ] Usage count increments if reused

**❌ Fail Indicators:**
- Custom tag not saved
- Not appearing in either table
- Stored as JSONB instead of normalized
- Display shows "undefined"

**Steps:**
1. Sign out of application
2. Try to access workflow completion URL
3. Observe behavior

**Expected Result:**
- Redirect to login page
- Or "Authentication required" message
- No data exposure

**Test 6C: Incomplete Form Submission**

**Steps:**
1. Start workflow but skip required fields
2. Try to submit
3. Observe validation

**Expected Result:**
- Validation errors shown
- Cannot proceed without required fields
- No partial data written to database

**✅ Pass Criteria:**
- [ ] Invalid workflow ID handled gracefully

---

### Test 7: Data Consistency Check

**Objective:** Verify data integrity across all tables

**Validation Query:**

```sql
-- Comprehensive data consistency check
WITH workflow_data AS (
  SELECT 
    ws.id as workflow_id,
    ws.document_id,
    ws.user_id,
    ws.step,
    ws.is_draft
  FROM workflow_sessions ws
  WHERE ws.step = 'complete' 
  AND ws.is_draft = false
  ORDER BY ws.created_at DESC
  LIMIT 5
)
SELECT 
  wd.workflow_id,
  wd.document_id,
  -- Check category exists
  CASE WHEN dc.id IS NOT NULL THEN '✓' ELSE '✗' END as has_category,
  -- Check tags exist
  CASE WHEN tag_count > 0 THEN '✓' ELSE '✗' END as has_tags,
  -- Check required dimensions covered
  CASE WHEN required_dims >= 3 THEN '✓' ELSE '✗' END as required_dims_ok,
  -- Counts
  COALESCE(tag_count, 0) as total_tags,
  COALESCE(required_dims, 0) as required_dimension_count
FROM workflow_data wd
LEFT JOIN document_categories dc ON dc.workflow_session_id = wd.workflow_id
LEFT JOIN (
  SELECT 
    workflow_session_id,
    COUNT(*) as tag_count,
    COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN td.required = true THEN dt.dimension_id END) as required_dims
  FROM document_tags dt
  LEFT JOIN tag_dimensions td ON td.id = dt.dimension_id
  GROUP BY workflow_session_id
) tag_summary ON tag_summary.workflow_session_id = wd.workflow_id
ORDER BY wd.workflow_id DESC;
```

**Expected Result:**
- All workflows show '✓' for has_category
- All workflows show '✓' for has_tags
- All workflows show '✓' for required_dims_ok
- No orphaned records
- All foreign keys valid

**✅ Pass Criteria:**
- [ ] All completed workflows have categories
- [ ] All completed workflows have tags
- [ ] Required dimensions are filled
- [ ] No orphaned records
- [ ] Foreign key integrity maintained

**❌ Fail Indicators:**
- Missing categories or tags
- Orphaned records (FK violations)
- Required dimensions not covered
- Data inconsistencies

### Query Features

✅ **Comprehensive Coverage:** Shows all data from Category Module Panels A, B, and C  
✅ **Organized Output:** Three distinct result tables for easy reading  
✅ **Handles Empty State:** Shows informative message if no completed workflows exist  
✅ **Visual Indicators:** Uses emoji markers for tag types and belonging assessment  
✅ **Detailed Metadata:** Includes IDs, descriptions, and timestamps for debugging  
✅ **Tag Summary:** Provides count breakdown of standard vs custom tags  
✅ **Fixed Errors:** Removed non-existent slug columns that caused SQL errors

### How to Use

1. Copy the entire SQL query above
2. Open Supabase SQL Editor
3. Paste and execute
4. Review the three output tables in the Results grid

### Expected Results Structure

**Table 1 - Document & Session Info:**
- Document title and summary
- Workflow ID and user ID
- Completion timestamp
- Document status

**Table 2 - Panels A & B:**
- Panel A: Belonging rating with assessment
- Panel B: Primary category selection with details (name, description, ID)

**Table 3 - Panel C:**
- All assigned tags organized by dimension
- Tag type indicators (standard vs custom)
- Tag descriptions and IDs
- Summary statistics

### Changes from v1:

1. **Line 709 Fix:** Changed `'Slug: ' || c.slug` to `'Description: ' || COALESCE(SUBSTRING(c.description, 1, 100), 'N/A')` - The `slug` column doesn't exist in the `categories` table

2. **Line 746 Fix:** Changed `COALESCE(t.slug, ct.slug, 'N/A')` to `COALESCE(SUBSTRING(t.description, 1, 50), SUBSTRING(ct.description, 1, 50), 'N/A')` - The `slug` column doesn't exist in `tags` or `custom_tags` tables

3. **Improved Display:** Added description excerpts (first 50-100 chars) for better context instead of non-existent slug values

### Database Schema Reference:

**categories table columns:**
- id, name, description, examples, is_high_value, impact_description, sort_order, created_at, updated_at

**tags table columns:**
- id, dimension_id, name, description, icon, risk_level, sort_order, created_at, updated_at

**custom_tags table columns:**
- id, dimension_id, name, description, created_by, organization_id, usage_count, created_at, updated_at, is_approved
